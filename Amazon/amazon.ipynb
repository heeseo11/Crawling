            "So I've been using bio oil for about a month now and It seems to be working. My newest scars have definitely been improving but my old scars still seem to be pretty dark. My face does feel alot smoother and more moisturized. It hasn't been irritating my skin and it's a great moisturizer. I use a very little bit just to get a thin layer over my face then I apply my lotion on top. I've also been using African black soap and witch hazel so the combination of these things may have resulted in this outcome but overall I'd say it's a pretty good product as adding it to my routine has seemed to help.\n",
            "This is definitely NOT the actual Bio-Oil brand. Consistency and scent is very different.\n",
            "This was definitely not like the first bottle I bought. It's maybe lasted 2 months compared to the bottle I got prior that last 6 months. The labeling is different and the consistency is diff. Will not buy again\n",
            "I have used bio oil for years. Love it, when its not counterfeit of course. This time I ordered it thru Amazon. The box was ripped and it appeared to be used, as there was no seal on the bottle. The consistency is watery and the color is a salmon pink instead of a more translucent orange color like the authentic version. Buy instead from target's offical website or an authorized retailer. Shame on amazon for giving such a large platform to counterfeit goods!\n",

A doctor recommended this to one of my friends who told me about it.  I have bought several bottles as gifts..  Be patient.  It will take a few months for you to see notice the changes.Now I am using it on my arms and hands. I hope have the same result.  I am 71 years old.  No one paid me to write this.\n",
            "A must buy!! I use this in combination with my African black soap. Has cleared up dark spots on my face\n",
            "I'm 31, and I've noticed within the last year (with the help of a careless lifestyle) my skin hasn't been bouncing back as well. I have little sections of orange peel textured skin an inch below my eyes, and across the center of my forehead. Not sure if you'd attribute that to acne in the past, or what.. but this Oil was worth a shot to \"repair the scars\". Now, as you know.. skin care is a risky game. We all have different skin types, as well as different skin issues. I'm not able to tell you what this will and won't do for you of course, but I know for me it provides glow and seems to be working quite well. It's super greasy, so I wear it at night and sleep on my back. Give it a try.\n",
            "Counterfeit!!!!! I read reviews only after purchasing which said a ton of the ones received were not the real bio oil. I kept this in mind when my package arrived. Immediately, noticed how STRONG it smelt. It reminded me of this fake rose hip oil that I previously bought from Walmart (which I also threw away as a result). This product was so terrible - It smelt like chemicals and plastic. A huge concern was that there was no seal, which was already a huge red flag - especially since many bio oil packages (depending on the OZ) have them very clearly. I did not put it on my skin.  I went to ulta & found the real thing. I am going to post below the two packages with the seals and markings so whoever might see this and buy it can see for themselves. According to youtube reviews, there is also supposed to be a scratch code for authenticity purposes that bio oil puts on their packages (? Again, saw this on a youtube review, but I didn’t open the ones at Ulta to find out). Mine did not have a seal or a scratch code to make sure it was the real thing. Very sad and hope other people contemplating buying this see this review and just go to ulta and pick it up\n",

I've had some weight gain and loss since childhood and it had left me with stretch marks that crippled my self esteem. I used this product infrequently a few years ago but noticed small results. I bought it again and have used the product twice daily for about 6 months. The discoloring on my stretch mark scarring has changed and now looks a lot more unnoticeable. I will definitely use this further in hopes time and effort will completely heal over the marks. I highly recommend it for anyone suffering from scars that they feel will never be gone. There's hope.\n",
            "I have eczema & I'm constantly trying to find basic skincare than I can use regularly. I have some really bad mosquito bite scars from last summer & some issues with hyperpigmentation, not to mention scarring from eczema outbreaks throughout the years. I saw this reviewed online & decided to give it a try, even though every other product they recommended for skincare was a bust for me.Not this! It smelled like it was going to be too strong & the consistency felt like it was just going to sit on my skin, so I was shocked when my skin drank it in & I had no irritation at all. Even better, after about two months I started noticing some fading & my skin texture felt better.Now it's been about four months & I'm a believer. I'm still on my first bottle (it seems like I've needed to use less over time or something), but I'm considering sizing up with my next purchase, just so I can drench myself in it daily...& I'm only kind of exaggerating. It's actually gentle enough for my face & I can't even use Cetaphil on my face (I use very gentle face wash & moisturizer).I recommend getting the smallest size if your skin is very sensitive, as it's not cheap, & I hope it becomes your new go-to skin treatment too!\n",
            "I've used this stuff for a few years, and I have to tell you it's pretty much replaced lotion for me. I don't put it on thick though. It makes my legs and feet silky smooth. Even putting it on the bottoms of my feet, they don't get greasy or slippery. I put it a dab on my lips to avoid chapping and lines. I dab some on the outside of my eyes to counter the crow's feet that are trying to form. Dry ankles, knees, knuckles, or elbows? Saturate them. Chapped nipples from running in the cold (or whatever you're doing to make them chapped)? Dab some on. I've used it on my face as a moisturizer in a pinch.I can't really speak to how it helps with scarring and stretch marks, but I would definitely recommend this product for basically full-body use.\n",
            "I used this for 3 days and by the 4th day, I was floored.  I noticed my skin had a \"tighter\" look and even younger.  I wasn't expecting results like that.  I also noticed that 2 freckles that have become blotches with age, are almost completely faded.  That was definitely unexpected.  My boyfriend actually commented on my face looking tighter and he had no idea I was using any new products, nor had I asked him if he noticed my face looking any different.  He is now ordering Bio Oil.  I am floored by this product and I am a huge skeptic on ny beauty care items being miracle makeovers.  This is pretty darn close!\n",
            "I used this twice daily starting in the second trimester and am happy to report NO STRETCHMARKS now after pregnancy! This is really saying something as I have been prone to strethmarks my entire life, as have my mom and sister: I got them bad in the teenage years. I used this product on my tummy, hips, and thighs along with a natural lotion (shea, coconut) to moisturize and have no new stretchmarks at all. I should add that I am 30yo, and have skin that easily bruises or injures. NOTHING! I would highly recommend this and intend to use it for future pregnancies.I also used it to prevent scarring. I passed out in the first trimester and cut my forehead; a legit Harry Potter cut. It really helped to fade the cut and subsequent scar.\n",
            "Upon the recommendation of a friend, I began using a different stretch mark product around 2 months before my daughter was born. This was long before I had stretch marks appear, but surprise! They popped up anyway. Totally expected this to happen- but this product claimed to prevent stretch marks so I was a bit disheartened. I continued using this product until my daughter was approximately 5-6 months old on the advice that I give it time, but saw no improvement whatsoever.To the important part of my review: I began using Bio-Oil upon the recommendation of the all-knowing Google and have been for around 7 months (my daughter just turned 13 months one week ago). It is INCREDIBLE. I cannot over-hype this product. Let me detail why:1. I have extraordinarily sensitive skin (I can't use Aloe or any lotion/wash with fragrance- my skin is that sensitive) and I am able to use Bio-Oil all over my stomach and legs with absolutely no negative reaction. I have not used it elsewhere so I am unsure what, if any, sensitivities could arise.2. I am paler than the palest-pale person. The stretch marks on my stomach and legs were a deep-purple tone and highly visible. I assumed that no matter how wonderful the product, they would never truly \"disappear\" given the contrasting colors.These two factors made me really concerned about the ability to combat stretch marks without some sort of professional intervention- such as dermatological work. I'm a full-time student in law school and my budget is very restrictive so I was motivated to explore more affordable options.*THE RESULTS*After 2 months of daily use, I began to notice significant improvement in both the visibility and the texture of my stretch marks. The deep-purple tone was much, much lighter. I would say that the results at this point were 10 times greater than any improvement I saw with the last product I tried.After 4-5 months of daily use, the stretch marks on my stomach were nearly the same tone as my skin. The were significantly less \"rough\" than before as well. The results at this point exceeded my greatest expectations.Today the stretch marks on my stomach are gone. GONE. I know that this product is not guaranteed to completely eliminate stretch marks, but it has with mine. The stretch marks on my legs are still visible, but they are much, much lighter. I faithfully use Bio-Oil on my stomach every morning after I take a shower- I imagine that twice-daily use would result in the reduction of stretch mark visibility even faster, but cannot say with certainty. I have not been as vigilant in the application of Bio-Oil to my legs and that is likely the reason why the results are less remarkable. I have no doubt that the more faithful application could result in the same improvement I've seen on my stomach and I will update this review accordingly.I continue to use Bio-Oil daily because it makes my skin silky-smooth and I hope it will reduce the appearance of stretch marks in the future.*OVERALL*I would recommend this product to everyone. Unless you have a specific allergy to the ingredients in Bio-Oil, give it a chance. Use it daily. Give it a couple of months- I have yet to find a more affordable option that offers results \"instantly.\" I am awed by the results I've experienced thus far.Here's a quick summary of this long review: I am 25 years old and White. I have highly sensitive skin. I love this product. My stretch marks are either invisible or faded significantly after 7 months of daily use.\n",
            "The Smell is hard to describe,... my first reaction was \"Ewww ,this is what everyone is raving about ,im just not seeing iti\" It has a weird , disturbing ,very synthetic  wanna be  cinnamon ( but not in a good way ,if that makes sense) top note  ...followed by an old  musty  stale arcid ending .After reading the other reviews i cannot believe  i missed the tons of bad reviews ,which  confirm what i suspected .This  is a complete and utter fake.My legs itched and it made no difference on my skin.This seller should not be allowed to sell a fake product here.Please save your money and buy from an authorized seller .\n",
            "I use this for 1 month and it getting better.\n",
            "I have now used Bio-Oil through 3 pregnancies (all within 4 years) and would not hesitate to recommend it.  I believe I am prone to stretch marks as I have them on my thighs from my teen years.  In addition, my mother and grandmother both have many marks from their pregnancies.  I started using Bio-Oil as soon as I found out I was pregnant (between 4-8 weeks) with all of my pregnancies.  I typically use it 2x per day (morning + night) all over my belly, lower back, hips, and thighs.  I went through 3-4 full-size bottles throughout each pregnancy.It absorbs well - I've never had an issue with it getting on clothes, bed sheets, etc. and the smell/aroma is minimal.  I'm fairly sensitive to smells, especially during pregnancy, but I never had an issue with this oil.For full disclosure, I gained between 20-30 lbs each pregnancy, my babies were on the smaller side, and I delivered between 3-6 weeks early with each.  So, take my review for what it is.  That being said, I do feel that the stretch marks on my thighs improved.  They were quite old (about 8-10 years+) and had already faded to white, but they are always much less noticeable after using Bio-Oil.  I'm not sure if this is solely due to just being better hydrated OR if the Bio-Oil really had an impact on old scars.\n",
            "I put this on at least 1-2 times daily since I received this 2 weeks ago. I use it on my belly where I have stretch marks from my pregnancy and I also use it on my face and it helps moisturize my dry skin. I can tell my face is clearing up from my months-long acne breakout AND I use the oil on my underarms after I get out of the shower to try and lighten them up. Since my pregnancy, my underarms had gotten kind of dark and I'm embarrassed to even raise them if I have a tank top on... It looks to be helping my discoloration on both my face (from my acne) and underarms and I feel like my stretch marks look different as well. Very impressed with this product. I will continue to use and hope to see even better results!\n"

            "This is the second time I’ve purchased Bio oil. I bought the small bottle the first time because I’m always sceptical of products with big claims. I am pleasantly surprised to find bio oil works very well on my skin. I mix it with my moisturizer products for my face. In a few days the Brown age spots began to fade. I wanted to make sure so I put just bio oil on brown spots on my arm. It worked!! I highly recommend this product.\n",
            "I really like this stuff. I'm not sure how well it works on past stretch marks, but it works wonders on scars. I got bit by a dog last summer and nothing was working to get rid of the scar. I also had a scar from a scratch on my knee, as well as chicken pock scars, and scars from a wrist surgery. This oil seems to be fading them all!I put it on once a day after the shower (if that), and I've noticed the progress, even without photos. I also think that it helps to spread/lengthen the life of other lotions as well (given that it is an oil, if you put lotion on your legs, less will go longer than without the oil), so it helps you save money in the lotion department.First pictures are when I first got bit, second is when I was trying products to fade the mark, and last is now.\n",
            "I especially love how this stuff doesn't stain my clothes after I put it on. It soaks into my skin fast and has a pleasant smell. I use this for my pregnancy in which I am now on my last month of. All the women in my family have stretch marks, but I do not. I contribute this a lot to not only healthy eating habits but this oil as well. Of course I use different lotions with it (Burt's Bees and Body Merry) but I like to apply this after I get out of the shower for quick absorbing. Not only that but I am super happy it is cruelty free. Major plus if you ask me.\n",
            "Best thing in the world. Saved my life. Love, love ❤️\n",
            "This 6.7oz oil arrived the other day and I was so excited!  I ordered it for my daughter for a few acne blemishes on her face and spots from ingrown hair at her bikini line.  I figured this would be an excellent oil to apply after using the Dark Spot Corrector Peel (face) and Evagloss Bumps Solution (lady parts) for a 30-day regime she's starting today. But I became agitated to find the manufacturer INTENTIONALLY listed (the Product's Description - \"Important Information\" section) Ingredients in SPORADIC ORDER. As a former cosmetologist, I'm certain this was done to deceive unsuspecting people about products and processed foods.For those that don't know, please note: \"The FIRST 3 Ingredients in ANY PRODUCT are the BASE/MAIN ingredients\".  Example- think of a cake calling for 2-Cups of Wheat Flour but 3/4 Cornstarch and 1/4 Wheat Flour is used instead.  The cake will be fine, however, substituting with 3/4 Cornstarch (or even half and half) defeats the purpose of using Wheat Flour.  The health benefits Wheat Flour has in terms of LESS carbohydrates, MORE protein, dietary fiber, vitamins and minerals became SIGNIFICANTLY DILUTED with artery clogging Cornstarch.  Same of this Bio Oil actually being \"Mineral Oil\" not \"Botanicals and Essential Oil\" BASED per the ORDER OF INGREDIENTS printed on the Product Label.  My issue is that some manufacturers obscure whether their Mineral Oil/Petroleum based product is highly REFINED or simply \"Treated\".  Although the FDA allows \"Mineral Oil (Paraffinum Liquidum)\" to be listed, they're NOT the same.  \"Treated\" (low grade) Mineral Oil doesn't necessarily mean all carcinogenic (cancer causing) or other toxins have been removed.  Highly REFINED Mineral Oil i.e., Paraffinum Liquidum is non-toxic/Food Grade thus safe.Most good products have good ingredients listed as the first. A product's components are listed by quantity highest to lowest and the first ingredients should correspond with the product states to be.  Mild to moderate chemical components (additives if any) should follow the 4th ingredient and so on which represents a products Base to Transition- even food.  It's like buying \"Shea Butter Body Wash\" yet Shea Butter is the 14th of 20 ingredients.  This suggests a ratio of at most \"5% Shea Butter\" to \"95% Other\" ingredients meaning it’s NOT a \"Shea Butter” body wash\".I'm not saying Bio Oil is bad, I've used Mineral Oil based products in the past and can't say they're all bad.  Through my dad (biology and chemistry major/global company chemical plant manager), I learned much more about components, interaction, and reaction, etc., beyond just a Cosmetology standpoint.  As I now suffer multiple autoimmune disorders, the onset was said to have been \"environmentally triggered\" meaning \"external source or product\".  It makes one wonder what could've contributed to, if not caused these ailments since I relocated 10+years ago.  I now carefully read labels (beyond the first 3 ingredients) and question some products that lack USDA, FDA and/or CGMP Approval.I was certain the first 6 ingredients of this oil stated nothing of Mineral Oil. In that, the label listing Mineral Oil defeats my efforts to ignore the reviews claiming \"fake Bio Oil\".  There's a reason the order i.e., quantity of ingredients are required and must be listed correctly on Product Labels.  Certain products may give the desired outcome in the short-term but the long-term effects of their ingredients can change and/or cause you to lose your life.Having 4.5 of 5-star ratings from 74K+ customers intertwined with very old (almost 10yr ago) reviews seems this oil is a good thing of the past.  At the end of the day, always remember \"First 3 is 4 Me\" to weigh quantity for quality in products.  \"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure\" so make sure you received what you bought not what you were deceived into buying.  With all that said, I just returned mine as the label spoke volumes of deception as seen and explained here.  Be blessed and stay safe!\n",
            "This product has changed my skin forever. I’ve been using it for a year and a half and my skin is better than ever. I mix mine with tea tree oil to treat my acne. It’s light, it smells great, and it treats existing skin damage. If you have sun damage, small wrinkles, discoloration, or acne scars you should give this six months and see if it works for you.\n",
            "I LOVE my Bio-Oil! I shower at the end of every day and right when I get out, I lather up my whole body with the oil, from my neck, to my arms, chest, stomach, sides and legs. I especially focus on rubbing in the oil on my sides and front and back of my thighs. The oil has helped to diminish my stretch marks on my sides, as well as cellulite on my thighs. Not to mention how soft my skin is! No joke. My skin has never been softer from a product. I have this healthy glow look to my skin that I’ve never had before. I ran out of this oil for about a month, and my skin stayed just as soft and radiant, I didn’t even use any other type of moisturizer for the time being. So this product sure works like gold. Only downside- the bottle isn’t big enough!! I go through this product way too fast for how small the bottle is. It is an oil, so it does make your skin feel oily, but it absorbs fairly fast!\n",
            "I did a lot of research before purchasing Bio Oil, as I've bought well reviewed products on Amazon in the past and not had any luck with them. After reading countless articles and glowing reviews, I finally bought a bottle and have been using it for the past week at night on my face. I go through my usual skincare routine and then apply a drop or two after my night time moisturizer.Let me tell you, I could not be happier! This past winter, my usual healthy skin has become incredibly dry and flaky and nothing has helped. After only a week, my face already feels and looks so much softer and even toned.The product is definitely greasy and takes time to absorb, but after fifteen minutes my skin is literally glowing and dewy. The only reason I havent been using it in the morning is because I'm worried how it might look under makeup. Overall, I would absolutely recommend this product to everyone I know :)\n",
            "Don't use it on your face especially if you're acne prone. Bought it to treat acne scars and it ended up breaking me out horribly and just making the situation worse. I looked it up on cosdna.com per my dermatologists reccommendation and it has ingredients in it that are acne causing as well as irritating. It would maybe be fine on the rest of your body but I don't really need it. Going to give it to someone.\n",
            "I don't wanna jinx myself, but I am 8 months pregnant and have used this religiously a minimum of twice a day since my first trimester--which, honestly, has resulted in me spending quite a bit, because I have reordered the largest size probably at least 4 times-so it hasn't been cheap. I haven't had one stretch mark, nor do I experience itchiness. My skin is always super supple. And after I smear my belly, boobs, and booty, I also make sure to do a one over and cover my face with it.I mix bio-oil with organic jojoba oil (which is supposed to be excellent for absorption) and castor oil (great for blood circulation and a variety of different things).

            "I’ve been using bio oil for years, mostly on my face. I used to have scars along my chin where I had a ton of breakouts, but they’re all but gone now! I have a different skin regime for my face now, so I use it mostly on my body due to pregnancy. It keeps my skin supple and I have not noticed any additional stretch marks. If you’re wanting to use this to get rid of scars, remember it’s a process and will take months, but it definitely pays off!\n",
            "This stuff is awesome! I purchased this product after my two year old was scratched on the cheek by a cat. My daughter ended up with a two inch scar down her cheek and I wanted to try this in hopes of getting the scar to at least be less visible. I rubbed a small amount of Bio Oil on my daughters cheek twice a day and within just a couple of weeks the scar had completely disappeared. I am thankful Bio Oil worked so well and my daughter was not left with a large scar down her cheek forever.\n",
            "I'm the most skeptical person I know but I had heard great things about bio oil so I bought it. I have been using on one arm for about 3 weeks and even after week 1 the difference was so noticeable I decided to use on the other arm as well. My age spots have gone from embarrassingly noticeable to almost non existent. I could not be more thrilled. Telling everyone woman I know about bio oil. I am 100% on board with the greatness of this product.\n",
            "Wifey: I love this oil!!! I got this oil when I was pregnant and smeared it all over my belly. Roughly three times a day. After having my baby I got Zero stretch marks. Now, I can not give full credit to this oil but it has a huge role in it, I think. I had stretch marks before my pregnancy, so I was adamant to do whatever I can to hopefully prevent it from developing on my belly. I highly recommend this product. Note- I did not notice that it reduced stretch marks appearance that are already there.\n",
            "This is probably my 12ty bottle. I used to buy at Walgreens for double the price! I’m glad amazon sells them. I use this for my stretch marks from being pregnant. Also on my heels to prevents ugly dry cracked heels. I love how subtle the smell is. Oh and I’ve also used it when i was pregnant. I slathered them food on my belly and I guess that’s why I only have super small and faint stretch marks because of it.\n",
            "I used this religiously while pregnant and I loved it! The scent is really nice, although some people might not like it as much as others because it does have a very strong essential oil scent. I originally bought this to help prevent stretch marks. I ended up getting a few on my hips and butt. However, I think this definitely helped keep my skin nourished and healthy all throughout my pregnancy. It is hard to tell how effective it was at preventing more stretch marks from forming since I don't know how many I would have gotten without it. But the product made my skin feel so healthy and soft. I highly recommend for any pregnant women out there or anyone looking for a nice nourishing product! It definitely is an oil so you don't need a lot of it. It spreads around really easily. I do warn that it will create oil stains on certain clothing. I would always put it on before going to bed and it created an oil stain across the belly of my gray night shirt. I'm not too upset about it since it's just a simple t-shirt that I only wear to bed, but if you are potentially going to use it before putting on a nice shirt, I would warn against it, just in case.\n",
            "Best advice was from a dermatological nurse I happened to meet at my surgeon's office.  Her daughter had just had surgery also.  Her advice:  Use BioOil daily on surgical scar once wound is healed, rub in the direction of the scar (not across it), and do not expose the scar to sunlight - for at least 6 months.  This advice was very helpful.  I now also use BioOil on my skin after showering.  It is wonderful.\n",
            "When I first used this I was appalled that it was mineral oil, which I never use. And in research found that Purcellin is a made up name for who knows what, but after using it, I can say that my dark spots are fading and I've been using it for only a matter of weeks. My skin looks better and feels soft and healthy. Who knew? Anyway, I'm a believer and have recommended it to friends.\n",
            "This stuff is awesome. I get dry patches on my face in the winter and since using this, no more dry patches! I have pretty sensitive skin and I can't use most creamy moisturizers because I'll break out, Bio-Oil adds the moisture I need without breaking me out. It also helps to reduce old acne scars and evens out my skin tone. As an added benefit, the smell is light and clean!\n",
            "I really don't enjoy doing the work to take care of my skin. When I do, I don't always enjoy the feeling of the product... and I've tried a lot since my mom keeps getting me different ones to try... both Asian and American products.This is the only one thing I actually enjoy using. My skin definitely is doing better. The scars are fading, my face is moisturized for a long time. AND it doesn't feel excessicely oily. Your skin absorbs the oil fast and it just feel more moist and smooth.\n",

            "So I was a little skeptical about purchasing after seeing reviews but decided to give it a try. Obviously, you can tell it was a success!! I ordered the 4oz and received just that. The box is the most updated version which is a plus (checked other retailers aka Target). After giving birth I had numerous issues this has helped me with including discoloration, stretch marks (new and old) plus my surgical scar. Well, FOR ME ( everyone’s body is different) within the 1st wk the discoloration started clearing up and I have also noticed my scar was looking so much better!!! still working on the stretch marks 2 times a day faithfully!!\n",
            "I’ve tried a lot of products to remove blemishes on my back. It’s the only place I have scarring, etc from acne (bacne) and a bad spout with picking from particular extracurriculars. With that said-and well into recovery-this stuff seems to be working. I pair it with aloe Vera gel and coconut oil. I think between that combo, it’s finally beginning to clear! I say give it a try! And leave us all a review in a month or so of use.\n",
            "My skin suddenly became uncomfortably dry when the temps dropped which was unusual bc up until now I had oily combination skin.  I tried a ton of moisturizers - best rated drugstore brands to well rated products by Sephora and Korean skincare that promised to fix my dry winter skin.  Then I found a bottle of bio oil I had purchased back in 2015 in the back of my makeup drawer.  After two weeks of dedicated use, both at night and in the AM and I can say that this stuff works! No more dry areas around my eyes and nose when the temps drops. After two weeks, I didn’t have any negative reactions either.  I’ve been recommending it to friends and they are all amazed.  Smooth, moisturized skin so far this winter.  I’m a devotee.\n",
            "This oil is MAGICAL!!! Over the years I've earned my stripes (and stretch marks and scars) and while not entirely making them gone, it does aid in lessening them, even the old ones! I recently had surgery and as soon as the bandages came off and I was allowed to put anything on it, I started using this. At first I mixed it with the Neosporin I used and covered with a bandage to keep it in contact with my skin as long as possible. I now use it combined with Vaseline with a non stick pad and use those latexish type restickable wraps. It's still fresh, but is lying down smoothly and is keeping my skin soft and supple. If pregnant, I believe starting at the first of your last triimester will help with the stretch marks.  Get you some of this stuff and get to it!\n",
            "I'm 27 and still struggling with acne and the scarring that comes with it. After one use of this over night I was pretty shocked the next day, my skin texture and acne itself looked noticeably better. It's now been only three days since I've been using this before bed time and I'm just amazed how clear, how soft, and how it's less oily my skin is throughout the day. Only slightly negative thing is I'm just not crazy about the smell, reminds me of an older ladies perfume because of the rose in it. Regardless this stuff is awesome and cant wait to see the out come of using it long term!\n",
            "I’ve been using this product for years on my face for left over acne scars/ skin tone. When I got pregnant I started using it on my chest, stomach, thighs, and bum area. Basically all the areas that can potentially swell when you are making a baby! Now I continue to use it on my stomach and c-section scar. Has worked great for sun burns/damage too.\n",
            "I wasn't sure about buying this at first, but took the risk based off of all the good results I've read about. I tend to be heavy handed with products and thankfully after a month of using this, the bottle is still basically full. I have normal type skin, but wanted to use this for my uneven skin tones and skin tags. After a month of using it, my skin looks a lot more even! It looks more youthful and has really helped with the bags under my eyes. Didn't really help with my skin tags, but overall I really like it and have noticed a difference in my skin.\n",
            "My arm was burned the skin was pink in some places and black in others. It has returned my skin almost to its normal dark pigment in just 6weeks of using.  I also use it on my face and it has started to lift my dark age spots. I am African American with a dark complexion.  My Bi-racial daughter in law recommended it to me.\n",
            "I love this stuff for my 5 year old daughter, she has a bad habit of scratching until she gets a scab then scratching the scab off which  creates ugly scars. Rubbing this on her legs daily has cleared her existing scars and helped hear scabs before she can pick them off.\n",
            "Used daily after the shower to prevent stretch marks during my pregnancy. Both my mother and sister have terrible stretch marks as a result of their pregnancies. After using this product I am so glad to say I don’t have a single stretch mark. I ended up having an emergency c-section at 38 weeks due to Hurricane Michael. I’ve used this product on my c-section scar and, after 3 weeks, can hardly see the incision line. I’m so glad I used this product and would definitely recommend!!\n"

I recently bought my second bottle. I love this stuff!\n",

Was so afraid my scar would stretch with my growing abdomen. No joke, after 5 months of twice a day application, it’s GONE! I can’t even see where it was! I will definitely be recommending this over any other otc scarring product.\n",
            "I was skeptical of how amazing the reviews are, but this stuff is pure gold. I use it on stretch marks on my legs-and in just a week they went from bright angry red to purple. I use it twice a day if I remember, and its amazing. I also rub it on my face after I wash my face, and rub it in super well-it has made my acne on my cheeks go WAY down, and is removing the scars. I have amazing skin now-I use this stuff EVERY day, and I've barely even put a dent in it. This size is amazing, and for the price-holy cow. I seriously never leave reviews, but seriously this stuff is pure magic. I tried vitamin C serum, rosehip, witch hazel, etc. and this is the only thing that has worked for me. Good luck!!\n",

I have used it once or twice a day daily and am currently 28 weeks pregnant and do not have any stretch marks. I’ve also gained about 30 pounds and it’s all in my belly so I’m huge. Even though stretch marks are genetic, I have stretch marks all over my inner And outer thighs as well as up the sides of my hips from being overweight in junior high. So I’m prone to getting stretch marks but haven’t received any from this pregnancy, kind of a sweet deal!\n",
            "We spend a lot of hours outside in the sun for my kids' sports, especially in the summer for travel baseball.  I noticed after this season my arms were developing several \"sun spots\".  I started using this oil and noticed a difference in less than two weeks.  Then within a couple more weeks, I noticed my hands were looking a lot younger and smoother.  I really love this oil and it's a part of my daily regimen for skin care.  It has made a significantly, noticeable difference and I am very pleased with the results.\n",
            "A little goes a long way!!! I love bio oil. I have been using it for 2-3 weeks now and I have already seen a lot of improvement in my skin. I have very fair skin and it scars very easily, and I used to have so many dark spots around my mouth. This product has helped so much! I use it only at night because it is too oily for my oily skin to wear during the day.\n",

            "5/24/2020 Bio-Oil diaries: the discoloration on my cheeks from a few years old acne scars is improving. My skin looks younger - it’s hard to describe.. but I can see a difference. It looks less rough. I’ve been using it morning and night. I’ll update again soon.5/19/2020 I found out about this product while scrolling through TikTok last week. It came highly recommended, so I decided to look up the price on amazon. After reading several reviews, I figured I might as well try it out. Today is the 4th day I use the product on my face. My skin looks dewy and nice. Maybe a little too oily, but hey - we're in Quarantine, so who cares?  My skin looks more even toned. So, let me give some background information on my skin that might help someone who can relate. As a teenager I had 0 acne. Very rarely would I get a period pimple. When I got into my early 20's I started taking a medication prescribed to me for PTSD. Unfortunately, acne was not listed as a side effect. I took it for one year and during that year I got cystic acne and scarring as a consequence. Just horrific, painful, depressing... and I couldn't figure out why. One day I decided to google the medication and acne side effects and to my horror, I found a bunch of info correlating the two. I stopped taking it immediately, but the damaging scars where there to stay. Through the years, I've tried several different remediations. I went to Ideal Image and had thousands of dollars worth of lasers on my face to help with scarring (they faded just slightly, but they were not gone), I've spent I don't even know how much on facials / microdermabrasion - I was going every 2 weeks because I could see a slight different with the microdermabrasion and I was on a mission to get rid of these scars before I turned 30. Welp, I'm 30 now. Have been now for 5 months - and I still have the scars. And now I'm here. With this new oil. Praying it works and writing a review. I'm going to put in the time and update this review as I go because although scars don't hurt physically, sometimes they hurt mentally. And if this product truly works and I can convince just one person to try it and lead them to success, then it is worth it. On the contrary, if it doesn't, then I can save someone the disappointment of trying yet another product and feeling let down. Right now I'm giving it 5 stars because of what I've seen and felt so far. Lets cross our fingers and see what the future holds.\n",
            "I have used this throughout my pregnancy. I apply It after I’m done with my shower and then I do a little rinse and pat dry with a towel. I feel like this product has kept my skin less itchy and irritated throughout the winter, and it has helped with the rough bumps I get From dry skin.\n",
            "I mixed the oil with Whole Foods lotion and it helps my skin stay soft and smell nice. The scent is so calming. It helps falling asleep easily. I almost finish my 2nd bottom.\n",
            "This was recommended to me by a friend to use during pregnancy. It never irritated my skin, and I'm now in my 9th month without any stretch marks or significant changes to my skin (and my belly has expanded a lot). Obviously our genes (and some luck) play into this sort of thing, but all I know is that I used this every morning starting around month 3 (along with lotion in the evening) and felt it was a great way to moisturize. One bottle lasts a long time, and there is no lingering smell on your skin.\n",
            "I bought this to use it during my pregnancy to help prevent/minimize stretch marks. I can’t speak on the effectiveness of that but I started getting this tingly/itchy sensation on my belly after I started using it. No rashes or redness but just more itchy feeling. The oil is non-greasy and generally feels good but I didn’t like the itchy feeling urging me to scratch my belly. After using it for a month and half, I stopped using this oil and just used my regular Aveeno body moisturizer, and I didn’t get that urge to scratch my belly- no itchiness. So, now I am hesitant on using it. Also, the contradicting information on this oil’s safety during pregnancy doesn’t help. I am looking to try a different product now.\n"

Wrong. Here is a list of the ingredients.

            "The smell of this is amazing - however it does not work so well for stretch marks. Also, I noticed that this is NOT mostly natural as mineral oil is first on the list of ingredients.I would definitely buy again because it blends into your skin quickly and won’t leave residue stains on your clothing, and it makes your skin feel so nice once it’s been absorbed.\n",
            "obsessed!  yes, it is as good as they say it is.  :)  in my 3rd trimester, measuring slightly above average, and still no stretch marks!  dries quick too so when you're in a hurry, zero concern for oil to get on clothes.  feels light, skin looks great.  preggers suggestions: breasts, belly, love handles, inner and outer thighs.  i use a shea lotion for the rest of my body to ration this product, so focus the good stuff on the most susceptible areas.\n",

For the price I said it’s worth a try. LET ME TELL YOU... this stuff did wonders for me. It faded out my stretch marks with in 4-6 weeks. Plus it smells great!\n",
            "Love love love!! Smells great and keeps you moisturized all day! Stop your skin from itching and all around great product. I have been using it my entire pregnancy. Once in the morning and again before bed. I’ve noticed that when I don’t use it, that’s when I feel my skin get a little itchy but once I put a little on, dry skin is gone. Absorbs really well too so it’s not messy on your clothes. You can get dressed right after applying. Best skin oil ever! I will use this even after baby.\n",
            "At first I was skeptical after reading the reviews but for the price I decided to try it. It smells really nice and you don't need much, and I have seen some results and I don't use it as much as I should because I always forget. I even use it on my face where proactive has failed.  I suffer from chronic pain and am unable to exercise so I even ordered one of those little massage cups to use with it.\n",
            "Opened package and it was open on the bottom. The box was ripped slightly! And part of the words on the bottle are scratched off. Also seems very liquid like water more then oil. I’m just not sure if this was used or fake! Very disappointed. Read reviews but bought it anyway because soooo many people reviewed. I feel compelled to go by from CVS down my street to compare to see if it’s real or fake. Packing is the biggest tip off it may be fake or was previously used. Scent is still nice but has a perfume quality vs oil quality. I’m not scared to try it but I wonder if it will have the right effects and maybe just return it? Boo. What a let down!\n",
            "Gonna start by saying I have very sensitive and blemish/discoloration prone skin. I have stretch marks on the inside of my thighs from gaining about 10lbs recovering from an eating disorder as a teen. I suffered from cystic acne from 20-22 and occasionally now (23). So when I learned I was pregnant, I knew my belly was going to be wrecked with stretch marks. As long as your baby is healthy it's worth it, but who doesn't want to avoid them? So I got online and researched and like lots of things when your pregnant, I forgot about it. Around 5 months when I finally started to show, I said screw it and bought a bottle of BioOil at the grocery. I kept telling myself \"I'll get one of those expensive special belly lotions/oils if this starts to not work\" but it just kept working! Here I am at 37 weeks, I've gone through about 24oz of BioOil and nothing else, and I am yet to have one stretch mark! Time will tell and I'll update this after my little boy gets here, but if anyone is looking for something easy to use that helps prevent stretch marks, try this first!  The texture is great, it soaks into your skin instead of just sitting on top and it really works! (PS I also use it on my breasts, so far it has helped prevent sagging and marks there too, even through the crazy growth) I really hope I didn't jinx myself but I just had to share with anyone else out there looking for a low maintenance way to avoid stretch marks. Twice a day, takes 2 minutes, and it works! I'll be using this postpartum and into the future as I age.Just to show how much my skin stretched I included a picture from before I was pregnant. Can't believe they were taken only a year apart! :(\n",
            "First time using bio oil. Bought the biggest bottle, as I’m planning to use it throughout my pregnancy.Seal or no seal: there is NO seal. There are so many conflicting info in the reviews and the Q&As. So I actually went to the local drug store and got one to compare. Same thing, no seal. The one I got from the store is the smallest size.Maybe years ago it came with a seal? I don’t know. All I know is that the current version doesn’t. So please stop calling it a fake because of that.Pros:I developed dry/red/flaky skin around my mouth since pregnancy. I tried lotions, serums and oil based essence but none of them last more than a couple of hours before the skin becomes dry and flaky again. I tried this bio oil around my mouth, it actually would keep the area moisturized very long. I do wash my mouth after meals and re-apply, so I don’t know whether it’d last a whole day, but it has been dramatically longer lasting than my other products. The redness is also reducing overtime. Not completely gone yet, but previous the redness was surrounding my mouth area, now it’s only at the corner of the mouth and above, nothing on the chin any more.My husband is also using it on his knuckles on one hand that’s itchy. It seems to be helpful for his skin condition too. We don’t know exactly what that is, the doctor just asked him to put anti-itchy cream which isn’t very helpful. This oil does help so he’s been using it.Cons:Gosh for me, it has to be the smell. I honestly thought it was a fake product when I first tried it because I really don’t like the smell! Some reviewers said they love the smell or it comes with a pleasant smell, no it doesn’t! That’s another reason for me to get one from the drug store to compare. It turns out that’s just how this thing smells. It has a a pretty strong oil smell that reminds me of industrial oil products. It doesn’t come with the any flowery or pleasant smell, not even like the basic no-smell oils, but actually something I dislike. So be forewarned. If you put a little on your palm, the smell isn’t strong, but if you rub it in, like on your tummy or on your face, holding your breath for a few seconds won’t do it. Since I do use it around my mouth, I even tried to mix it with my other non oil based serums to cover its smell a little, which helps but it also reduces its moisturizing effect. Since it’s the only product that works with the dry skin around my mouth, I’m biting the bullet. The smell doesn’t linger for long, so that was helpful.If you are not sure about the smell, get a small bottle to try it out. At least for me, the benefits out win the smell issue for me.Funny that I’m not mentioning any stretch mark effect as pros or cons. I actually have developed some stretch marks on my lower back and my butt cheeks before using this product since the pregnancy, not on tummy yet. I don’t expect the product to get rid of the existing stretch marks or at least not in a short period of time. Maybe in a few months it’d get better over, and more important to me is for prevention of new stretch marks.\n"

I only use it once per day but I’m sure if I did it twice per day it be even more effective! I’ve used the oil several times on my stretch marks and i’ve seen a little improvement as well.

            "I used this during my first pregnancy! I started using it in the second trimester, usually only 1x per day and then used it 2x per day during my 3rd trimester when I could remember. In the end I had gained about 35lb and had 1 small dime sized stretch mark around my hip area (where I didn’t apply Bio Oil as often/regularly. Even my OB commented on how surprised he was that I didn’t have any stretch marks! Super pleased with this purchase. Pleasant scent, rubs in easily. Will definitely use again if we are fortunate enough to have more children!!\n",

I know most stretch marks tend to be genetic. However, this is my 2nd child and I have No knew marks!! It’s also helped diminish a big scar on my knee. I’m a believer!I bought on amazon b/c it was $10 more at any store I found it at!\n",
            "I have been using this stuff every other day (alternating with coconut oil) to moisturize my skin as my belly grows. I loved the scent and the way it moisturized so much that I now use it on my entire body. I haven't gotten a lot of stretch marks, but I did eventually develop some on my hips / top of butt and under my breasts although I was using this product. I think developing some stretch marks is normal, especially with my genetics, as I am prone to getting them! I have continued to buy this product over & over throughout my pregnancy because I think it does a great job keeping my skin as elastic as possible. I would not recommend using this every day or more than once a day because I did notice that if I did this, I started to develop acne on my chest and stomach and random places on my body. I think the oil started to clog my pores. Overall, if you switch off using this with another lotion and skin product, I think it is a great addition to help with pregnancy stretch marks! Also, let's be honest, this is not the cheapest product out there, so switching off with something else will make it last a lot longer. I hope this helps!\n",
            "Idk if this works but it makes my skin feel really lux!\n",
            "Okay, this stuff is AMAZING. I’m usually very skeptical of hyperbole, so I didn’t really expect much.  Within a couple of months, it has faded the brown hormonal spots on my cheeks (don’t forget your sunscreen, ladies...) that I’ve had for years and they are almost gone. I wish I had taken a before pic so I could show how dramatic the results are, but I didn’t think it would work so I didn’t bother. But this is where it truly sold me— I had this precancerous thing right in the center of my chest. Dermatologist had to freeze it off and it looked terrible. Asked the dermatologist If it would scar and she shrugged and said, probably but Mederma *might* work...but better than cancer (again with the sunscreen). I hated it because it was high up in the center so I couldn’t wear any of my summer spots. Tried using the bio-oil—again, not expecting much—and within a month, it has faded so much that it’s barely noticeable! Can’t wait to show my dermatologist lol. Same thing for a nasty second degree burn scar that just wouldn’t go away—it is!!I wish I had known about this stuff when I was pregnant because I have no doubt that it would prevent stretch marks. It is *that* good and less than half the price of Mederma. Also feels great, not greasy at all, skin immediately absorbs it. It is my favorite product and I use it on any skin issue now. GET IT!!\n",
            "This is a MUST HAVE for expecting mamas.... I used this two-thirds times a day during my pregnancy starting at month 2 and have NO STRETCH MARKS on my tummy!!!! I gained 65 lbs this pregnancy too!! My body stretched at full capacity very quickly, yet this oil truly truly helped prevent stretch marks... highly recommend using coco butter with it!\n",
            "Love this! I’ve been using it at night to help lighten hyperpigmentation from acne, and I’ve definitely noticed my skin looks clearer and more glowy. I have sensitive skin, so I do have to watch this around my eyes as it irritates the delicate skin there, but This doesn’t seem to break me out at all, and it’s such a great value.I apply this at night to freshly cleansed skin then follow with a thing layer of moisturizer to “lock it in” but you could probably skip the moisturizer, as this is an oil. Definitely don’t apply during the day though. It’s too heavy:l/ greasy for daytime use and even a little bit will make your makeup slip and melt within a few hours.\n",
            "As a mom of four who has used this religiously in every one of her pregnancies I can say that it’s the best I’ve found as far as moisturizing goes. I love that it doesn’t stain and the scent is nice.  With that said though, it’s not a miracle for stretch marks! I don’t think there is such a thing out there that is, but it sure would be nice if there was!! Regardless, it’s definitely my go to, it helps relieve my dry itchy belly as it grows! ❤️\n"

I've already placed another order for 2 more large bottles!\n",
            "I used this product since beginning of 2nd trimester. Daily use apply on my tummy after shower. So far I don’t have any stretch mark. And I brought another bottle. The only thing I don’t like it very much is the perfume seems a bit too strong for pregnant women.\n",
            "I recently had a surgical procedure that left me with a fairly serious looking scar on my neck. Unfortunately due to its location it’s highly visible. I believe the surgeon did his best to minimize the visual effect but it is still out there none the less. This seems to really make a difference in hiding/reducing the appearance of the scar. It’s been about 3 months and the difference has been incredible. The scent is light and pleasant and does not overwhelm your senses.\n",
            "Used this in combination with skinception because bio-oil is much more affordable, alternating between products (one in the morning and one in the evening) and it has drastically improved my stretch marks. It's been several months, they haven't disappeared completely but they aren't as visible.\n",
            "I don't know why they advertise this product to pregnant women. It contains retinyl palmitate which could be harmful to the unborn baby. Please do some research before purchasing this item if you are pregnant!!!! I obviously tried to return the item since it contains this ingredient but they won't give me back the entire amount.\n",

            "I started using Bio Oil at the beginning of 2016 per the recommendation of my dermatologist. At the time, I had cystic acne that left behind hyperpigmentation and scarring of all different hues--purple, brown, red--all over my face, mostly on my cheeks and temples. My acne lasted up until the summer of 2017, at which point my skin cleared up for good. I have been using Bio Oil twice a day, every day, throughout this whole ordeal (2 years now) and now I have NO hyperpigmentation or scarring whatsoever on my face. Also, due to all the different products I've used while I had acne, I now have extremely dry skin. Bio Oil is great for that too! I still apply it morning and night, and I have no dry or painful patches on my face. I've recommended this product to several friends who have acne scarring and hyperpigmentation and they have experienced the same results! (Sorry no before/after photos, I didn't keep any pictures of my scarred skin!)\n",
            "This is not the authentic product the bottle is very different.And smell weird.I’ve been using bio are you open on throughout the years and I’ve never had a break out on my skin ever and no smell  until today, when I put a little bit on my hands and wrists .it cause my skin to itch and 2 small bubbles up as you can see on my right wrist.I’ll send it right back. Never again will Purchased this product from Amazon I will go to Walgreens or CVS Purchase their original one.\n",

            "Every woman (and man!) needs this stuff. I have had stretch marks on my legs since I was 13, and I feel like after using this for about 2 weeks they have started to fade. I put this on my inner thighs, breasts and scars I have on my face and it is seriously a magical oil. I would recommend this for someone who is pregnant or has irritating stretch marks.\n",

            "I've used this product for over month and realized something: I think this is counterfeit. I've paid almost twice the price for Bio-Oil from dermstore and 1) the smell is different, 2) the viscosity is different, 3) the effect is different. With derm store, I don't feel tacky after applying this post shower, my skin is so smooth and stays moisturized even 24 hours later. I remember thinking \"wow\" at how soft and smooth my butt felt the morning after my shower. With this, the oil feels thicker and it initially feels a little tacky. You would think that this would result in even more moisturized, smoother skin, but my skin doesn't get the smoothness I get from legit Bio-Oil, and legs and butt are back to their normal, rough, super dry selves.I think this is snake oil. Not the real Bio Oil but THIS specific Bio Oil from THIS specific seller on Amazon.For the past month I've been using this product trying to figure out why this Bio Oil was acting so differently. Then I smelled someone's baby oil and realized this really is working no differently than the cheap baby oil you can get at the drugstore. So if you want the same effect of THIS counterfeit Bio Oil, get it for much cheaper at the drugstore. Smells the same. Acts the same. (And without the orange dye!)If you want to see what everyone's raving about when it comes to Bio-Oil, get it from a legit retailer like derm store.Amazon's getting pretty heinous with its peddling of counterfeit products! You think it's legit when it's offered as Amazon Prime, but this is pretty shady.Anyway, I get it. It's soooo much cheaper from this seller and you want to see what the fuss is about. Once I finish this bottle (I mean, it doesn't really work, but I paid for it and it's too late to get a refund), I'm trying the Bioderma after shower oil. It's a HUGE bottle for a fraction of the cost of legit Bio Oil. And it smells really nice, too! A little like powdery violets or iris. Hopefully, since the Bioderma oil is not yet a cult product, the one I got from Amazon is not a counterfeit.\n",
            "This is genuine bio oil. It is the same packaging that Target has and is the same color and smell. Thanks to this stuff, I went through my entire pregnancy without stretch marks and it has greatly reduced the appearance of my c section scar in just a few months! Absolutely swear by this!\n",
            "Someone recommended this oil to me after I had thyroid surgery. Remarkably, it has significantly lightened my scar in the month I have been using it. I apply this product twice a day (sometimes only once when I go to bed). HIGHLY recommended!\n",
            "Healed my surgical scar beautifully!! Nice in Have in the winter\n",
            "Got this oil to help with pregnancy and avoid stretch marks. I oil up every day. Still got stretch marks. The bottle it comes out of it messy and you don’t see it when you set the bottle down but it collects around the top and as soon as you set it down it drips all over the bottle and the surface you set it on. Smells like an old lady. Was not impressed AT ALL\n",
            "I use it as legs oil, or anywhere I need extra moisture. Smells great too, absorbs very quickly and doesn't leave skin feeling greasy.\n",
            "I admit that I purchased this before looking at the ingredients.  The upbeat add sold me.  Howeve the minute I put it on, I knew that I had been bamboozled.Whatever effect people think they have found is actually no different than consistent use of a moisturizer placed on skin and the sealed with Baseline, petroleum jelly, or mineral oil.  Peep the ingredients.  The first clue that this product and its claims were hype is the fact that the oil is mostly mineral oil...the same product that undergirds all of vaseline's products.  Those clinical tests are not vigorous scientific clinical double blind trials.  The n is too small. The time span is too short. Et cetera but this does not stop them from telling you that in order to \"see improvements\" you have to use their product for 3 months.  I repeat, no better than consistently, appropriately using vaseline.Buy it if you like potions, magical thinking, and have no concern for efficacy.  Maybe this is the product for people who don't know how to properly moisturize their skin like \"dihydrogen monoxide\" is for people who want to quench extreme thirst.C'est la vie.Aside - it has a mild, offputing afterscent that I worried about everytime I used it.  It is like a \"clean\" day care bathroom.\n",
            "I received this product on or around May 30. Since receiving it, I've been using it every day, twice a day per the instructions, and I still have more than half of the bottle left! I use it in the morning before I get my day started and then again in the evening before bed. I apply generous amounts on my face neck and both of my forearms. I was a bit worried that I would go through the bottle so quickly, but I'm surprised I still have plenty.This product works well. I noticed that many of my stubborn acne scars and blemishes have faded. I had some pretty bad blemishes around my neck from tweezing and poking at in-grown hair and those have nearly disappeared, and I'm no longer embarrassed or forced to try to cover up with makeup (which obviously just made my neck worst). It has also worked well to reduce the wrinkles on my forehead and laugh marks/wrinkles, and it has even out my skin tone. I tend to scar and get dark spots from bug bites and I've found that this product also works on those. I did notice, however, that it does not work as well or quickly on more recent blemishes nor does it work on fading freckles.The product itself is moisturizing and it has replaced my daily face lotion. But it does leave my face looking oily. I'm not sure if makeup would help mattify my face (I haven't worn makeup since COVID), but since I've just been at home, the oil doesn't bother me.\n",
            "I had a total knee replacement and a friend recommended this for my scar.  I have used this 2X daily and my scar is almost gone at 4 months post surgery!  My orthopedic surgeon was very impressed by the healing of my scar so early.\n",
            "Got this as a gift when I was first pregnant. Really reduced my stretch marks and helped me not get any new ones. Much better than cocoa butter. Not greasy and quickly absorbed in the skin. I have pretty dry skin as it is, but this got me through the winter.  Loved it so much, I bought another bottle for myself when I ran out.\n"

I put it EVERYWHERE I thought of. I’m now six weeks postpartum, and no stretch marks! I plan to keep using it as it is very moisturizing too!\n",
            "This product is loaded w petroleum and mineral oil which is a big no no.. after using this product on my belly for a week My entire belly broke out in small hives/pimples. Only after switching to organic oil the hives went away... i would not recommend this product for kids or expecting moms\n",
            "Wow. This was absolutely horrendous. I used it on my face and I BROKE OUT in a terrible red rash, had bumps everywhere, my skin was all swollen and red and extremely itchy!!! It’s been a few days, been taking allergy medication and it’s changed th texture of my skin completely! It is so rough and bumpy everywhere and I am so sad. I just finished accutane and had perfect skin. This RUINED my face. PLEASE DO NOT BUY\n",
            "Although I just started to use Bio Oil I can already see a visible difference in my stretch marks. The redness has begun to subside and my skin feels soft. Looking forward to incorporating this into my daily routine, so far the results are promising!\n",
            "I’ve been using this product for a while now on a very large scar and some stretch marks. It hasn’t made much of a difference for the stretch marks, even though I’ve also lost 10lbs in the time I’ve been using this oil. The stretch marks are being very stubborn.However, it has softened the appearance of my supersized scar. It also keeps the scarred area well hydrated throughout the day, which prevents itchiness. I would say that I prefer having this oil on my scarred area as opposed to not having it.I accidentally got some of this oil on my face one morning and assumed I would breakout - very happy (and impressed!) that was not the case. It felt quite nice actually! So if you’re considering using this product on your face, it’s got my seal of approval.Overall I like this oil and enjoy the way it feels on my skin, particularly the scarred area that’s prone to dryness. Not sure if I will purchase more in the future though, since it doesn’t seem to do anything for my stretch marks. I may test out a few other products and then choose a favorite.\n",
            "The ingredients on the package of oil that I received are not the same as those listed above, which should be listed in order of prominence in the formula. The first ingredient is actually mineral oil which has a 9/10 rating for safety based on these concerns:• Cancer (moderate)• Developmental/reproductive toxicity (high)• Use restrictions (high)• Non-reproductive organ system toxicity (low)• Biochemical or cellular level changes (high)Many women are buying this because of pregnancy, so I wish I had read all this before I bought. I do like the product. It smells great, and even when i was nauseous all the time I enjoyed the smell. It doesn't absorb that quickly but I liked it. But now I am afraid to use it. It just doesn't seem worth the risk. The ingredients on my bottle match exactly the ingredients on a cosmetics safety website. I just dont know if it's worth purchasing this rather than a more safe moisturizer.\n",
            "Bio Oil has a great smell, not too strong or overwhelming and the oil is rapidly absorbed into my skin. A little does go a long way but it spreads better right after a shower for me. It doesn't work well if your skin is dry (at least, not for me) which is why I use it right after the shower. It leaves my skin very soft. I just started using it but many report it has lightened stretch marks and scars.\n",
            "So, I was nervous about using this because my legs tend to get clogged pores easily or just get irritated easily. I use this after showers and give it a bit to absorb. I do feel like my scars have soften in appearance, but this product does take time to fix skin concerns and I think you need to use it for at least 3 months to see any intended results. The smell is good and it does absorb okay (might be a little oily, but when I wake up I just have hydrated legs). I feel like it has been good for my tummy which sometimes feels like it just isn't smooth. Like how cellulite can look, but not quite the same. I do work out, but it just never looks smooth, but that is changing and this is something I have added to my routine so I feel like this is doing something. I do use Fur oil for post-shaving and this layers good with that. I did order a larger size and do feel like it works well for me.\n",
            "I was super worried about getting stretch marks during my pregnancy, especially because I had them on my boobs, lower back, and thighs from my adolescence. At two months I started using this morning and night, and made it to my delivery at 39 weeks exactly with zero stretch marks. I gained right about 40 pounds total. I’m not 100% positive that I skipped the stretch marks entirely due to this product, but I’m personally pleased with the results!\n",
            "During my previous pregnancies I used other lotions and oils to avoid stretch marks and was fortunate to only have a few relatively small stretch marks. When I found out I was pregnant with twins I began looking online for products with good reviews and came across this product and decided to give it a try. I used this religiously at least twice a day starting in the beginning of my second trimester up until my delivery date. It worked wonders! I didn’t get any stretch marks during this pregnancy and gained a significant amount of more weight with my twins than with my single pregnancies. I recommend this oil to all my pregnant friends now.\n",

I’m pregnant with Twins and used lightly on stretch marks, then a little on my legs, feet, arms and breast’s. A tiny amount was used on my belly. Within 2 days, I broke out in a nightmare rash. My fingers are covered in a pin needle flaring bumps. My legs, feet, and arms are on fire covered in the rash that is a variety of patches. Thank God there’s a minor rash on my belly since I didn’t use much on it. I hate this product and wished I would have just used something simple like coconut oil, but I trusted all these reviews and magazine articles saying it was a “miracle oil.” It’s a nightmare oil! Use of these chemicals in products should be illegal. If it works great for you, your skin must be triple thick leather. Don’t trust it! Never again!\n",

It came in one day, the box was in perfect condition, safety sealed, the bottle was perfect as well. I even asked the question how to tell the difference of a fake before hand on here and the manufacturer said there is a cross at the bottom with a batch number. It was all there. So I was testing it out and the smell is a little cinnamon-y atleast to me. It absorbed really well and I didn’t need much product. Will update in a bout a month or so after using the product consistently.\n",
            "I’m writing a review based on my first day of usage. The scent is like cinnamon.  Which I wasn’t sure I could get used to. But either my nose acclimated really fast to the scent or the scent dissipates once spread onto your skin.  The oil is not greasy when your in it into your skin. Unlike Neutrogena sesame oil. But I really like being able to use the neutrogena oil on wet or dry skin and the bio oil can only be applied on dry skin. Now compared to the Nuxe Huile multipurpose oil the Bio oil is a better deal.  But the Nuxe is almost like a perfume so I don’t bother wearing perfume when I use the Nuxe. The Nuxe is not greasy but leaves a little more of a sheen than the bio oil.  But the bio oil claims to even out skin tone...I will use this oil for three weeks and give another review to see if it has evened out my skin tone.\n",
            "I have used bio oil for the two years and it helped me overcome many skin issues like dark spots, stretch marks, oily face, etc...But for the last 5 months (weirdly since they started selling bio oil in groceries stores like Walmart or costco) the product quality has gone down slope.1. The prices keep changing and getting ridiculously expensive for no reason. I used to buy the 4.2pz bottle for $10 top before tax and as I am writing this review it is almost $16 !!I did signal this to Amazon and got an automated corporate response.2. The oil is normally a bright pink coral color. But lately the color is flimsy pale orange. Maybe color tangible chrmically but the quality is so much cheaper.Plus the oil is making me break out !I would say if you can buy something else just do it. At least until the product returns to its golden days\n",
            "I'm returning it! It is packed with mineral oil ( read: distillate of petroleum). Better find out what it does for your body. I would call it liquid cancer. Just can't believe it has so many good reviews..... people don't read ingredients.. and don't understand them.ALSO before ordering I had checked ingredients in old version I have (purchased 4 years ago or so) and it didn't have mineral oil in it.\n",
            "The natural, plant oil ingredients are heavily promoted but there is a long list of chemical ingredients as well and I am not a fan. The scent is nice, like baby oil, which of course is another added chemical but it is what it is. I've read multiple reviews for Bio-Oil over the years and most of them were good. I bought it mainly to use on my keloid scars to smooth out their appearance. So far I have only applied twice (just got it yesterday afternoon) but upon waking this morning, the scar tissue already felt considerably softer and wasn't as rough feeling/looking. My pores weren't clogged either. Usually if something is going to cause me to break out, it does it quickly, so waking up to clogged pores wouldn't be out of the ordinary for me if this affected them. It is very greasy though. I added it to a roller bottle for easier and consistent application and it does take time for it to absorb into the skin and even then, it doesn't completely and is still too greasy feeling for my personal tastes (especially in the summer heat). What I have done both times I have applied the thin layer is allow it to soak in for about 30 minutes or so while I do other things and then blot off the excess with a tissue. I am anticipating that for daytime application, I will have to blot more than once as it gets hotter outside. I am not sure how anyone who wears makeup would be able to use this under it.FYI: It was a toss up between trying this and some of those silicone scar sheets but I didn't really want to walk around with a large bandage on my face all day long (they have to stay on for at least 12 hours). So, my plan is to finish this small bottle of Bio-Oil and then see where I am at before continuing or trying the silicone sheets or finding a way to use the natural ingredients on this product and make my own. I am giving 3 stars for now mainly because of the chemicals.\n",
            "I LOVE BIO OIL. its the best investment i have ever made in my skin care routine. I don’t even need to use face masks daily anymore. I just wash my face morning & night-apply alcohol free witch hazel toner & then bio oil. A little goes a long way. I use to get regular acne break outs but since this product i would rarely get any pimples. I swear on everything this is the best formula for your skin. Forget all those other expensive products & go for this. I even introduced this oil to my friends & family where they are using it now too. I apply it on other parts of my body as well. It whitened my elbows, knees & leaves my body feeling soft & smooth. I’ve been using this product for about 5 months now & my face is so clear. People always ask me how im always glowing with radiance even without makeup.\n",
            "I had a breast surgery in the fall of 2019 and it left me with the notorious lollipop scar that was a dark purple color, I started using this oil in April 2020 it is now July 2020 and my scars are almost completely faded to a very light pink skin tone color I am on my 3rd bottle. It also works really well for tattoos! I use sunscreen on my body art but after time in the sun and dry skin my tattoos started to look faded, I apply my oil after I shower and all my tattoos look like I just got fresh ink!  This is now my daily oil I use from head to toe.I was in no way paid or given a discount for my review, I have had great results with using it everyday and thats the only reason for the 5 stars.\n",
            "I have used Bio Oil for several years and find it to be a good product. I’ve gone through many bottles, and while it hasn’t erased my stretch marks, I believe it has helped to blend in and lessen its harsh appearance (my stretch marks are deep and used to be purple and red a long time ago, but now the pigment is more skin toned). I am tan skinned and it has done well on my tone. It’s moisturizing and I like to believe it does great things for my skin. It’s safe to use while breastfeeding and pregnant, which is a bonus. The scent of Bio Oil is very distinct and strong, but I personally don’t mind it too much because I put it on before bed so no one smells it but me.As far as the product itself goes, I like it. However, I’m giving three stars because my bottle just arrived today and looks like it’s missing product (view attached photo). None of it spilled into the box... it makes me question either it’s authenticity or if it was used and returned. I will be looking elsewhere to purchase this product.\n"

            "I was hesitant to purchase on here with all the reviews stating this was fake; but I’m really glad I took the chance! I haven’t used bio oil since my first pregnancy (3 years ago) but the scent and consistency of this bottle purchased on amazon is exactly as I remember my bottle from years ago purchased at target being. Has the same light scent and absorbs very well. I mix it with the palmers coconut oil lotion and it works amazing! My skin feels so moisturized and soft. Super happy with myPurchase and glad I took the chance of buying it on here!\n",
            "I am pregnant and bought this because I heard it's amazing to help prevent stretch marks.  I currently am mixing it with shea tummy butter and putting it on my stomach, breast, thighs, and butt.  It smells great.  I plan on using it twice a day.\n",
            "I can't honestly say this helps remove the look of scars or stretch marks (I'm not sure anything is really a \"miracle product\"), but I can tell you that it is a light oil that dries quickly and doesn't leave you with a greasy feel or sticky residue. It goes on well, absorbs well, and is a great moisturizer. It has a nice clean scent to it. I always use this during and after pregnancy (I'm on #2 right now) and while I still have some marks from my first am hoping with keeping things moisturized there won't be more after this one.I use this on my face too (putting the residual from my stomach and sides on my face when I'm done) and I love it for a facial moisturizer! I do think it has helped brighten my freckled face a bit. And if it's possible to even a freckled, pale face - it has done that. I do not have the splotches of red or rough places on my cheeks after using this for a few weeks.Try it. You'll find benefit from it one way or another.\n",
            "Anybody looking to reduce stretch marks from pregnancy or even just weight gain please read this! I’ve tried SO many things and honestly nothing worked while I was pregnant so I’m pretty sure genetics got me there. But I’ve been using bum bum cream all over my stomach in combo with bio oil (not combining, separately I wait for one to dry before applying another. Then I use nivea deep nourishing serum lotion all over my stretch marks during the day. I drink tons of water to make sure my skin is staying hydrated (drink half your body weight in water to keep hydrated for your body) & all of this seems to have worked! After about a month my stretch marks went from dark dark to super faint some barely visible. Even my fiancé noticed a huge difference. I’m wanting to lose a significant amount of weight so I started a diet and recently started using sugar scrubs all over and exfoliating & using a dry brush after showers before applying these creams to try to avoid loose skin but the results I saw came before I started that. Hope this helps someone.\n",
            "Okay, I can’t say good enough things about this product!1.) Q: Does it diminish the appearance of scars and stretch marks? A: YES! I have had four children and struggle with deep stretch marks, and I also suffer from a chronic condition under arms that causes scarring. Both of which have diminished (not completely disappeared mind you) over a two month period of time. I use as direct, twice a day.2.) Q: Does it have any side effects for people with sensitive skin? A: My skin is prone to sensitivity, but I have not experienced any issues whatsoever.3.) Q: Does this work as a moisturizer? A: Absolutely! I use this after bathing each day, and I love the silky feel of my skin along with the fresh, somewhat baby powder scent. I’ve also used it on freshly shaved skin, and to my dismay it has treated razor burn and razor bumpsI absolutely love this product and am getting ready to purchase my next bottle. This will be a product I will continue to use as long as they continue to produce it.\n",
            "First of all: scent! Everyone was describing the smell as a perfume smell- it's not. It's basically like pure cinnamon extract. I bought this product in the small size as a test for my face. I read all about the reduction in stretch marks so decided to try that as well without much expectation. I had my daughter 10 years ago- and since using this product my 10 YEAR OLD STRETCH MARKS ARE DISAPPEARING! I cannot BELIEVE it! I didn't even think it was possible! It's been a great product for my face as well, using in conjunction with Sydney Riley's Lactic Acid treatment (a product I've been using for over a year). My skin is more even, rejuvenated and glowing! I'm 35 with very fair skin, not super sensitive. This will definitely be a permanent fixture in my skin regimen!\n",
            "This stuff is AMAZING! I have only been using it for 6 or 7 weeks and it has made such a difference in a large scar that just wasn’t healing. The picture that is a little darker is from before I started using the oil and that is 1 year after the initial injury. The lighter picture is the same scar after using the oil twice a day for about 6 weeks. This has done more for my scar than anything else I have tried. It’s a great price and works wonders!  I did try it on my face for extra moisture, but it did give me some pimples even though it says it is comedogenic, I would not recommend for your face. I have used it on other parts of my body to help with dryness and it has done a great job for that too!\n",
            "I know there are a lot of genetics involved in stretch marks for preggos but I'm on my 2nd pregnancy and still no stretch marks. I use this every night after the shower. They only annoying this is that it is very liquidy and takes a long time to dry. I wouldn't do this right before bed as it will get all over everything. But otherwise, seems to be working beautifully! And I love the smell!\n",
            "This oil was recommended to me by few of my girl friends back in Europe. Each one of them swore that prevented them from getting a stretch marks. My first thought was that this is too good to be true but decided to give it a try even though I though it was priced little higher than I would like it to be.  My order arrived quickly and I was eager to try it right away. At that time I was little over 3 months pregnant and my stomach was staring to grow. It’s recommended to use it in the morning and at night. I end up using it only in the evenings during the week and the days I was off I was suing it twice a day. Been using it during the whole pregnancy. I Was holding off to review the product so I can see the results for myself. I am happy to report that my skin doesn’t have not even one little stretch mark after I gave birth.Pros:Must have- amazing long lasting moistureNo stretch marks after using the product(for me at least worked like a miracle)Cons:I wasn’t not able to use in the morning under my clothes for work because it’s very moisturizing/ oily and I was scared to damaged my dresses\n",

This product is full of toxic ingredients such as coumarin - shown yo cause liver damage and retinyl palmitate. Here is a direct quote from the EWG on retinyl palmitate:Too much preformed vitamin A, including retinol, retinyl palmitate, retinyl acetate and retinyl linoleate, can cause a variety of health problems, including liver damage, brittle nails, hair loss, and osteoporosis and hip fractures in older adults. Excessive vitamin A can also cause serious skeletal birth defects in a developing fetus. For that reason, Norwegian health authorities have cautioned women who are pregnant or breastfeeding to avoid cosmetic products with vitamin A (Norwegian SCFS 2012b).Please protect your baby and use something else!\n",
            "This oil is honestly incredible. It actually works. I use it for my deep stretch marks and scarring on my stomach and thighs. It has a nice powdery smell too. The only thing is it is very greasy, but worth the trouble! I see some reviewers are saying that they received a fake product, and their pictures confirm that.. for that reason, I would say probably safer to purchase direct rather than through the Amazon seller.\n",
            "AMAZING!!! Im very pale so any scars or blemishes or really any “imperfections” show up very easily on me. I have some nasty self harm scars from a while back and after only two times using the oil my scars have looked so much better and less nasty and dark. worse scars are still the same but the noticeable change in some of them made me really happy! (I would add a picture but I don’t want to accidentally trigger anybody)~It’s also super moisturizing! I have dry skin and was ready for this to not do much but i was wrong. It moisturized my skin perfectly (remember that a little goes a long way!) and made my skin feel so smooth and soft 🥰\n",
            "So far so good. I've been using it for almost a week. It is lightweight and smells nice. I love the bottle it comes in. Definitely ended up liking this product way more than expected, and I do feel like I see a difference already. Either way, it definitely helps to make my skin so soft and well moisturized. I use it in combination with the burt's bees mommy tummy cream! Perfect combo.\n",
            "After hearing good things about Bio- Oil, I purchased & have used this for the past week in attempt to ward of the stretch marks I am expecting with my pregnancy. I am trying the 2oz option (rather than committing to a larger bottle) to see if I like it.Pro - I like the scent; it almost smells like honeysuckle.Con - it's not cruelty free & I wish I had researched that better before purchasing. I will look for a cruelty free product next time.As for quality of the product, I cannot comment as I have not been using it long enough. It does moisturize very well and has staying power.\n",
            "This oil is the best for preventing pregnancy stretch marks & dry skin! I used this everyday on my belly & other dry areas & it prevented any stretch marks that I know otherwise would have appeared, which is why I’ve ordered the large bottle for my second pregnancy.\n",
            "I feel like the redness and irritation on my skin have gotten better after just a few applications! I have PCOS, which also gives me these darker patches of skin on my neck and inner thighs and this seems to have really improved that already too!The scent is something between baby lotion and medicinal, but it’s not offensive.I’ve been putting this on as part of my morning and evening routine (it recommended using it twice a day) my skin stays hydrated all day but not oily like I was worried about, it seems to absorb fairly quickly! I will definitely be making this a permanent part of my skin care routine and buying more.\n",
            "I rarely ever write reviews, but this is probably my favorite beauty/body care product of ALL TIME!A dear friend recommended this product to me nearly a decade ago after I was left with an ugly scar after surgery.  She had used this post-mastectomy and raved about how well it diminished her scars and made her skin more supple.I used it and was hooked!  In all fairness, I am not sure how well my scar would have faded on its own had I not used this, but it worked so well and so quickly to smooth my skin and soften the scar tissue on my knee, I ended up using it as an allover body moisturizer!I now use this religiously after I shower.  I can tell my skin \"misses it\" if I go more than a day or so without using it.  My results were so impressive, my husband now uses it as his daily moisturizer!Also, the smell is divine!  It reminds me a tiny bit of Chanel No 5, but very, very subtle and does not interfere with my fragrances.  Obviously, not an overpowering or particularly \"feminine\" scent, as my husband uses it and does not find that it interferes with his fragrance, nor is it too \"girly\" for him.All in all, this is the best beauty product of ALL TIME!\n",
            "Discovered during pregnancy & have been using it daily ever since. I apply it after showering all over my abdomen, hips, thighs. I've found this product to reduce & prevent stretch marks during & following pregnancy. The oil has a light fresh scent which quickly fades. It is super hydrating & quickly absorbs with no greasy residue. Well worth the price - best price on Amazon!\n"

It restored my skin's soft, smooth texture and has faded the discoloration. At 75+ years of age, I look years younger and am very pleased. I have been using it 2x a day for a little over a year and discontinued other cosmetic moisturizers for my face. Excellent results, simple to use and affordable.\n",
            "Ok wow... this stuff is amazing. I gained some COVID weight... 35lbs to be exact which is the biggest I personally have ever been which means, yep! Stretch marks... They're on the back of my thighs and side of my thighs. I'm pretty diligent about moisturizing after showers and before bed but that didn't help the stretch marks go away while they're still in the purple phase. I've used this serum, with a lotion on top of it (that's how serums work, paired with a moisturizer), for only 3 APPLICATIONS, that's it, and they've already softened and faded. Way less prominent and obvious. Buy this stuff! I can't speak for stretch marks or scars that are already settled in, but if you're still in the purple/pink/red phase then this will be a huge help.\n",
            "I'm prone to stretch marks. I know this after ending puberty with my hips and derriere covered with them and no, I did not gain weight as a teenager. At 6 feet tall the most I weighed was 125lbs back then. My mom has a belly full of stretch marks as well.  That being said,  when hubby and I started trying to conceive stretch marks were a concern for me. I did not want them on my tummy. After looking at reviews I decided to go with bio oil. This combined with Palmers Coco butter straight out of the shower every night and most mornings were my saving grace during pregnancy. These pictures were taken the week before I gave birth. NOT ONE STRETCH MARK.  I would recommend this to anyone.  As for the smell, I personally loved it even throughout my pregnancy.\n",
            "The safety seal was missing and the product's cardboard box appeared to have been opened previously as it was bent around the edges. I tested some of it on my hands and it felt extremely greasy, sticky, and watery. This greasiness is not normal for Bio-oil. I believe this product is a fake or has been watered down with mineral oil or vegetable oil. I'm returning this product because every Bio-oil I've bought has always had the safety seal and I have no confidence in this seller. Scent smells normal if you sniff the bottle, but once you put it on your hands and aired it out, the smell was too strong, much stronger than the normal fragrance in Bio-oil.\n",
            "I have used this with my two previous pregnancies and have started to use it again for my third pregnancy. I have had minimal stretch marks which I got in my first pregnancy. During my first pregnancy I found out fairly late and feel had I used the item sooner I could have avoided the stretch marks I have now. The oil itself smells great and it is great on my sensitive skin. I’ve suffered with eczema since my childhood and never have had any adverse reaction to this product. The product leaves your skin feeling moisturized and helps give overall elasticity to the skin. Your skin will feel as smooth as a baby’s bottom in no time. As a recommendation I would not stop using my lotion I use on a daily basis but use this in conjunction with this. I also find I get the most benefit from this product when I use it right after a shower. And also at night so my skin has more time to absorb it.\n",
            "It works!!!! I have only ever had stretch marks on my boobs so I never really cared until suddenly I started getting them on my arms and stomach area and I was absolutely horrified and embarrassed so I would wear long sleeved shirts in 85 degree weather and things that would cover my stomach and refused to go to the beach eith my family. I stumbled upon this and started using only once even though it instructs twice a day for the max results however just once a day and it worked like from angry purple Mark's to where I didnt see the after effects of the stretch Mark's. It truly is a wholly grail when so many other products never worked. One thing I dont like is how hard it is to wash off my hands even after many washes but i found ways of avoid getting it on my hands.\n",
            "I love Bio-Oil and I was so glad to see it in such a big bottle. This product is amazing for reducing scars and stretch marks--not just fading them they actually are reducing the depth of some of my deeper stretch marks they are almost completely even with the surrounding skin and I have only been through a little over half the 2 oz size bottle. I apply a little twice a day and exfoliate the areas with a scrub twice a week and I have seen amazing progress in less than a month. I would highly recommend this product.\n",

            "I liked the way it smelled and how it didn't feel heavy/greasy so I'm giving it 3 stars. Unfortunately after using it one time on my surgery scars I had a severe allergic reaction to it. I had tested it on the inner part of my arm before hand and had no issues but I guess the scar tissue was more sensitive. I'm assuming I must be allergic to one of the flowers in it. As a warning to all, you can have a pretty bad reaction to it like I did. My scars look absolutely horrible now, the hives I got went all along of scars [all the way across my entire torso] and made the scaring triple in thickness and bump out. The swelling from the reaction lasted for a week, the hives and intense itching/burning lasted for almost 3 weeks and I am still suffering from random itchiness and some noticeable hives are still along my scars. I won't post a picture of the reaction because it was pretty disgusting looking, it was extremely red, covered in hives, and leaking clear fluid. I don't have really sensitive skin or anything so I did not expect this kind of reaction. My scars are really bad now and theres really nothing I can do about it.\n",
            "I had high hopes for this product as it was very well recommended. However, it didn't work for me at all. No lighter color, no smaller scars or stretch marks. I used it in several areas of different sizes. It just didn't work for me. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. The color of oil I got is MUCH lighter than the original bottles my friends and family have as well. I think this may be part of the problem. Maybe I got a bad batch or maybe the seller is being deceptive. Who knows. Didn't work though.\n",
            "I used this 2xs a day morning and night and sometimes 3xs a day on gym days after a shower during my entire pregnancy. Both sides of my family got stretch marks from pregnancy I assumed I would too. I used this product faithfully even before my baby bump grew I started about month 2 in my pregnancy once I found out I was pregnant. I never got a single stretch mark. Perhaps it was this product or just genetics, staying hydrated or all of the above I don’t know but I think it’s worth the try and money because I didn’t get any. I used it on my face in the morning and night even before I apply makeup for my dry skin and it works great. I would say get it it’s worth the money! But use it faithfully... if your using it for stretch mark prevention.\n",
            "I used this throughout my pregnancy from 4 months on (that was when I started showing) until I gave birth - I diligently put it on my belly every morning before work and always after showers.  I have 0 stretch marks, yes you read that correctly - zero, zilch, nada, stretch marks from my pregnancy.  I would highly, highly recommend this product and I will most certainly use it again for future pregnancies.\n",
            "This is the best product on the market!  I had skin that looked like sand paper and was worried about the \"prune look\" so I set out to try many products and overlooked price which resulted in a hole in my pocket.  The outcome; I tried petroleum jelly and that made me break out with a rash.  Finally, I found Bio-Oil and wow, I looked hydrated and I paid such a small amount of money.  Best of all, I wasn't greasy.  After a few minutes, the oil seeped in and I looked radiant!  So thrilled!  Now, I am using it on my dry hair and it is working.  So very grateful for this product.  Yesterday, I ordered a bigger bottle.\n",
            "As the title says I'm currently 39 weeks and I still haven't seen any stretch marks appear on my skin. I know it's largely hereditary, but my mom and grandma got plenty of stretch marks during pregnancy and so far I've escaped unscathed. I started using this daily around 17 weeks. I hardly even had a bump, but it felt nice and was a way to pamper myself. Now that I'm close to giving birth my belly is definitely big and the oil has been so nice to have. I bought a few lotions for stretch marks and pregnancy and I honestly really don't like them much. The oil absorbs nicely and instantly gets rid of the itchiness I get from my skin being so tight. I wouldn't be upset if I did get stretch marks as I know they're hard/impossible to truly prevent, but I'm happy so far I'm still clear of them and I'd still use this regardless cuz it feels so soothing on my skin. Also I have really sensitive skin that rashes easily and turns red and this hasn't given me any issues. The scent is mild, and possibly not something everyone would like but I have no issues with it. Plus since the smell is mild its not noticable anymore after it absorbs.\n",
            "As you have read/or heard, stretch marks are mostly genetics but i think your social habits and pre weight/pregnancy weight gain factor into getting stretch marks too. My mom and two sisters got stretch marks during pregnancy, however, I did not. I gained approx 20 lbs during pregnancy and being 6 weeks postpartum now I am back at my weight before pregnancy. I used this oil intermittently for the first 4 months of pregnancy because I was too sick to “care” to apply it everyday and the scent of the oil made me feel nauseous. But into my 2nd and 3rd trimester I used it 1-2 x a day, everyday. The consistency of the oil is similar to an oil based lubricant such as jojoba oil. I’m sensitive to smells so the smell to me is quite strong and somewhat unpleasant. If you have morning sickness you may not like it. As you can see from the photos I did not get stretch marks but I’m not sure if it’s more so my genetics/minimal weight gain or that the oil helped. What I do know is that I put the oil on other areas I have stretch marks and it did not seem to make a difference such as lighten them. I would recommend to at least try and use it everyday to see if it makes a difference for you since it won’t hurt.\n",
            "I have been using this for a couple months now and haven't really noticed much of a difference with my scars.  It has a pleasant scent, absorbs quickly, and isn't greasy, so thats a plus.  I probably won't buy it again, but I don't regret this purchase.  Sometimes you just need to try stuff to see if it works for you.  This, in terms of lightening my old scars not so much, but its fine otherwise.  The instructions recommend 3 months of use so I will continue to use it until it is gone, if my scars change I will amend this review.\n",
            "I bought this oil because of the great reviews I saw but when I started applying it my skin got scaly dry patches and when I read more of the reviews some of the comments were suggesting it is fake so I bought another bio oil from ulta and I tested both the one I got from Amazon was oily and my skin didn't absorb it but when I applied the one that I bought from ulta my skin absorbed it and it wasn't sitting on top of my skin. I discarded the oil I bought from Amazon and my skin is going back to normal. I never had a dry scaly skin before applying the oil I got from this seller.i also was disappointed that it doesn't have a safty seal .\n",
            "I used this product for my first pregnancy and I'm using it again for my second pregnancy.  I'm not someone who likes body oils or lotions that feel too oily, but, like most pregnant women i know, I am scared of getting stretch marks.  At the recommendation of the internet, I ordered this and gave it a try.  Firstly, the smell is strong and florally.  I am not one sensitive to smells, but if smells irritate you in the slightest, do not buy.  The scent lingers on your skin and clothes even hours after you've applied it.  Application wise, i felt like i needed a lot of the product to get good belly coverage (example, i need a whole palm-full to cover my current 24 week pregnant belly, including hips).  One bottle lasted me an entire pregnancy, with daily application starting around 20 weeks.  Feel wise, as the name suggests, it is oily.  BUT, i love the way it made my stomach/skin feel.  It prevented itching from the stretching that occurred as my stomach grew, and the softness and moisture lasted over night and into the next day.  I had 0 stretch marks from my first pregnancy, currently, at 24 weeks, I have zero again.  I will continue to use this pregnancy and any future pregnancy!  Very happy with the product.\n"

It also got rid of my ‘Chicken skin’ (Red bumps on legs and arms). I really wish I took a before and after photo for comparison. I will try to post one soon to document progress.Honestly I use this oil all over my body. I’m extremely satisfied with my purchase. It’s an amazing price for what it can accomplish.\n",
            "I am using this stuff for my newly acquired stretch marks from gaining weight since covid started and I couldn’t go to the gym. I never got any stretch marks while I was pregnant so I was pretty upset when I noticed I had pretty bad deep ones on my inner thighs and some on my love handles. I use it twice a day at night and morning so far I haven’t noticed much but it has helped a little. I’ve only been using it for a couple weeks though and it said about a month or two until you see the actual results. It’s very moisturizing and doesn’t have a very strong smell. The light smell it does have is nice too. I will update in a month or two to let you all know if it continues to help or is just a bust. A lot of people I know swear by it though and my legs are super soft now!\n",
            "It's hard for me to give this product an accurate rating since I don't use this product as often as recommended, so I'll give the most honest review I can of this product.I ordered this product 3 weeks after delivering my first child to help reduce the appearance of stretch marks.The good:The product came quickly and is described correctly. The product has a nice, simple smell that is somewhat floral but not overwhelming or overpowering. The oil is thin and is soothing to the skin. I have sensitive skin and I know that some women get stretch marks in these sensitive areas, but have found no problems using this product. I apply this product to my sides and bikini area. You need very little of this product for application. The oil doesn't stain or leave a residue on the skin. It is easily washed off hands.The bad:This product isn't cheap, but more reasonable than other products on the market. The container I ordered was very small (2oz) and it cost roughly $8 dollars. The product doesn't come in a very application-friendly bottle. I wish this came in more of a squirt bottle fashion. The bottle has a hole on the top where you can gently pour some onto your finger tips and apply to the desired areas. But since this product is expensive, you don't want to waste it, and it's easy to spill with the way the container is designed. The company recommends to apply this to the desired areas twice a day for 3 months to see improvement. I've been using this product (not twice a day...who has time for that with kids??) a few times a week after every shower and have not seen improvement yet. My stretch marks are small (thank goodness) but they are very dark purple. I will continue to use this product until it's gone to see if my stretch marks improve.Side note:I have been using this product a few times per week for 1 month and still have SO much. You can't even tell that I have used this product at all, since you don't need much for application. I recommend buying a smaller bottle to try first.\n",
            "I actually can't tell you if this is effective or not.  I can't use it because of the perfume used in it is very strong and, to me, offensive.  My surgery was delayed, so I didn't need it when I thought I would, and consequently it was too late to return it when I realized I would be unable to use it.  I'm considering mixing it with something else now to get the benefits and to be able to use it - but honestly - the smell is so overwhelming and difficult for me to handle that I don't imagine that will work. I'm planning to make my own concoction from recipes on the internet now.  I'll check each ingredient before I add it.It's almost as if they think the Bio-Oil should function as a perfume.  Just awful - so disappointed.\n",
            "02/12: i have sensitive skin and this has already reduced redness after 3 uses! i have insanely bad acne on my chin, but this helps lessen the redness. i do have sensitive skin myself and i personally like the smell! i haven’t used it for long but it hasn’t 100% taken away my acne scars. i’ll just have to continue and hope it does!UPDATE 03/14: i skip days of using this and i also use birth control and sometimes wash my face w/ other products (i should more, but 🤷🏻‍♀️) on to the review! so i have bad acne scars from picking at my chin due to hormonal acne since i was like 17-18! dude this has been clearing it up like no tomorrow, they’ve always been super red and a little bit goes a long ways! it’s one of my biggest insecurities. i also had some between my eyebrows and they’re completely gone. my chin is fading but isn’t completely gone yet, but i have noticed more of a change using this than any other product and i’ve used soooo many, even super expensive ones. i love this and will continue to update. :)\n",
            "My first pregnancy I used this product until I ran out, when I ran out I had a few other tummy options including Mederma, Coco Butter brands, etc. My stomach was looking great so I tried the others. Within a few weeks of switching brands I found my skin starting to itch and feel significantly tighter and before I knew it stretch marks were popping up everywhere. It could have just been the timing of when I ran out of Bio-Oil but this time I will be using it my entire pregnancy. Many of my friends swear by it - at the end of the day I know a lot of it is genetic but it is nice to feel moisturized as your belly is growing. This product has been incredibly moisturizing didn't ruin my clothes - although I do let it dry before putting on my clothing and don't wear materials that might be extremely susceptible to ruin.\n",
            "I was really hoping to like this and I just don't. The smell reminds me of a worse version of that Avon skin so soft from 10 years ago. It's not the worst but it's not great either. I did have a few problems with it that make me regret buying it at all.One it does not absorb into my skin so much as sit on top of it. It makes it impossible to use it under makeup because it stays greasy all day. Even using only a few drops all over my whole face is somehow too much.Two I had to stop using on my face after a week because it was giving me horrible blackheads.Three it did absolutely nothing for my stretch marks. There was no change in color or size.Four it was drying out the skin on my face. As oily as it is, it was only covering up dry patches, not making them better.I will admit it did lighten a burn scar on my chest, but only a bit and it is by no means gone. I get different people have different skin but it just didn't work for me. I'll probably keep using it on the stretch marks and the burn until the bottle runs out, but I don't expect much to change. I will 100% NOT use it on my face again.\n",
            "I'm a 65 year old seasoned citizen. I used Bio-Oil in the past; years ago when I had a hysterectomy and again for a knee surgery. Now that my skin is becoming more uneven toned and really looking aged, I have decided to go back to this oil. It helped me before and I a believe it will again. I've banged my ankles on an expensive rocking chair that has a pointed base. It's so sharp that I had to cut two tennis balls and place them on the sharp points of the rocker at the base. I am hoping the oil will get my ankles back to looking normal, as well as, the rest of my  body. I purchased the 6.7 oz because I know this will be a long process; my skin will not return to normal over night but after 2-3 months I should start seeing some good results. If you need a good body oil for unevenness, then give this a try. It may take a while but it is worth it. The oil goes into the skin and is not as thick as some of the others.\n",
            "This has been great! Only have been using off & on for a couple months, and I’ve already noticed it lighten certain dark areas of the skin/scars.I’ve been using it as a preventative option for stretch marks during pregnancy. It leaves my skin SO soft. Just like any other oil, you have to be aware of how much you apply. You are able to use a generous amount over a large area. I will be restocking for after the baby!\n"

            "This is my second time purchasing this product. I was sold on this product late last year. I am all about skincare. What I love about this oil is that it can be used all over the body. It has a delicate fragrance that is not overpowering and the oil itself leaves your skin soft. You can apply this on your face before your foundation which works amazingly! This has helped my dry t-zone area and also great for chapped skin. It has also helped a few scars too. I HIGHLY recommend this product as a daily skincare product to use and to add to your routine. It's affordable and a little goes a long way! PS, if you find your skin looking aged and dehydrated, it helps so much OMG!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE\n",
            "This product isn't fake. It even says on the top of the bottles package, \"New Look, Same Formula\" or something like that. I even checked their website and yes, the brand recently changed its look. The smell may be slightly different, but I also had my old bottle for a loooong time, so the smell probably is slightly different.Also comparing the size of bottles saying they sent fake product... this is available in different size bottles.The 2 oz bottle is plenty for quite a while. I had the larger size before and it started going brown by the end because I had it for probably 5+ years.Anyway, as for the product. It has done wonders for my keratosis pilaris on the backs of my arms. I apply while my skin is wet right after turning off the shower and it keeps the back of my arms moisturized for days, so the skin doesn't get as rough and bumpy. Is it completely gone? No, but its a huge improvement.It has an herbal type smell but I got used to it and like it now.Great product!!!!\n",
            "I used it it’s helping to get out of your markes\n",
            "I'm often pretty skeptical of products on Amazon even with great reviews because a lot of companies offer discounts for leaving a good review. This company does not do that, and they do say that you have to use the oil religiously twice a day for about 3 months to see results, I used almost the entire bottle and let me tell you, this stuff works. It's a very light scent and smells good and its super moisturizing. I was not pregnant I just had some really bad stretch marks on my belly from gaining weight very quickly and they've been there for a while so I wasn't sure this would help. It has taken all of the redness away from the marks and they are barely visible. Yay bio-oil. I'm about to buy my second bottle to see if I can completely get rid of the marks but the 75% reduction is worth it to say the least.\n",
            "El producto es una mezcla de aceites, tiene una fragancia fuerte más no intolerable. En cuanto a cicatrices y marcas no note ninguna diferencia pero debo decir que después que se va el óleo en la piel, la deja radiante y más firme. Toma en cuenta que si tienes una piel grasa esto no va funcionar para ti, ya que la mezcla si es un poco pesada. Si decides comprarlo recomiendo usarlo por las noches y que no tengas que salir a la calle ya que la piel queda excesivamente brillosa\n",
            "At the beginning of the year, I developed a rash on both of my lower legs.  It was bad enough that I went to the dermatologist and got a prescription for an ointment.  That cleared up the rash, but left my legs rough and dry in large patches.  All the body lotion in the world wouldn't budge the dryness.  I tried jojoba, marula, rosehip oils with a little bit of success, but they only provided marginal improvement.  I found Bio Heal on Amazon while looking for something else to try.  This only arrived a few days ago but it is already improving the condition of my skin on my legs.  I can see real progress after only a couple of days use.  The skin is finally softening and the dry patches have disappeared.  You can bet when I get down to the end of this bottle I'll be restocking.  I don't ever want to be without this oil again!\n",
            "This product is not for sensitive skin! I had purchased this item for my stretch marks specifically. The product highlights it’s multi-use but that is not the case at all! I applied this to my triceps and developed a very bad rash after applying it twice (like instructed on bottle). Don’t risk your skin! For those thinking why didn’t you patch test? I did and nothing had happened on the first application. It was the second time I used it that I got the irritation. I have filed for a return and will not use product again! VERY UNSATISFIED.\n",
            "Quite amazing moisturizer and goes on super smooth. I'm in my 23 weeks of pregnancy and I don't think I have any stretch marks or will have any stretch marks.\n",
            "The reviews saying this was a knock off freaked me out so much, I immediately went to target and bought a the smaller size to confirm! Target is on left and Amazon is on right. Both are the exact same color and exact same gross “cinnamon-y old lady” smell. Despite the smell, I’m having an eczema outbreak as well as going into my second trimester of pregnancy, so I’m looking forward to hopefully the magic of Bio Oil that I’ve read about!\n",
            "I’m very stretch mark prone. I have marks from growth spurts during adolescence. I used this for my first pregnancy on my belly, but I had my first baby at 31 weeks due to preeclampsia- so I never got any stretch marks on my belly. I did however get some in my hips- where I didn’t use bio oil. So I remembered for my second pregnancy to also put it on my hips! This second pregnancy I used bio oil every morning and night liberally, and towards the last couple weeks I would even put it on mid day (during my toddlers nap time). I would also use Sky Organics Shea butter at night with the bio oil, recommended by another reviewer.  I liberally applied to belly and hips- and thankfully I didnt get any new stretch marks! I’m going to use this nightly now that I’ve had my baby, as my stomach stretched back to normal.\n",

I usually put it on after a shower and then again before bed.It is fabulous, you guys! seriously.I'm Pakistani and have a slight more dark caramel complexion with hyper pigmentation on multiple parts of my body (chin, elbows, knees, bikini area etc.). After consistent use all over, the hyper pigmentation has faded SO MUCH, my arm pit stretch marks, booty stretch marks and some scarring has improved significantly.The moisturizing aspect of it is great cause I use the oil instead of lotion.PLUS it smells great! I often use it during a massage session as well.I loved this product so much that I got 4 more for family and friends!Would HIGHLY recommend.\n",
            "I’ve only been using for two months. What I noticed within that time was the radiance and this sort of youthful glow whenever I applied the oil. On days when I skipped or forget the application, I do notice my skin/face looked tired and dehydrated.  So on that note of skin being nourished and being supple, it definitely met those expectations. Now on the scar lightening/removing claims I have yet to really see any of those improvements, though I understand that to achieve those takes a longer time and full commitment. I have seen a couple spots disappear and reappear now and then, or was that my dirty mirror...wait....lol.  With that said, the fragrance is pleasant and although a little thicker in viscosity than other oils, it applies easily—-seriously you only need two dabs on your palm for your whole face. Probably use less if you have oily skin.  I’m pretty sure I’ll buy this again because that skin nourishment really makes you look like you’ve turned back the hands of time.\n",
            "Not a big fan of this. I had read so many reviews on it, and that it was recommended on scars by others. For me, personally, the fragrance is unpleasant and overpowering. They could scale it down 10 notches or get rid of it altogether. Additionally, it contains BHT as a preservative. I don't love it overall. I may use it up on my feet, but anywhere closer to my face makes the smell punch me in the nose. I recommend using pure sea buckthorn seed oil or rosehip oil instead of this. I'm just not a fan of added fragrance, especially if it smells like OLD LADY.\n",
            "I used a Berts Bees belly butter DAILY during my pregnancy trying to prevent stretch marks and it didn't work! It wasn't until about 7 months post partum I decided to give Bio Oil a try on my C-section scar and stretch marks. Within one week there was already a noticable difference!!! Even my doctor who I've been seeing every other week noticed my scar was lighter in color!!!I love the light scent this has, it soaks in quickly and gentle on my sensitive skin.I highly recommend Bio Oil for new and old scars!\n",
            "I couldn’t really see full results because i stopped using it. I was recommended to use this for old acne scars on my face. My skin is not all that sensitive and definitely is not prone to break outs. I havent had a pimple in years. Applied a very small small amount to my face and within a week i was broke out. It clogged up my pores terribly. May work for you but ill try other products for that purpose. The smell is a very floral “grandma” smell. Im really not crazy about it.\n",
            "I’m in my fifties and olive skinned. This product has helped my skin look better. I use it twice a day - under my makeup in the morning and before bedtime. My eyes felt a burning sensation and were watery during the first 2-3 weeks. That reaction went away. It is not painful. I continued to use in spite of my reaction to the oil because the product is not cheap. I’m glad I continued to use it. I’m on my 3rd bottle. I had a few sun spots on my cheeks that got lighter. I gifted one to my sister. I love this product and highly recommend it. It does not have a scent.\n",
            "(Update below) I honestly can’t believe this. I’ve been using this once or twice a day for only three days and my stretch marks that were pretty deep and dark have already lightened up SO much. I didn’t think I’d be seeing results this fast. I’m swearing by this stuff now.UPDATE!! I stand by what I said before, you do have to keep using the product though which I’m okay with BUT I have spells or dry scalp issues every now and then, usually during the fall when the air is dryer than I’m used to. I usually just let it go away on its own but I have a hair appointment in two days so I didn’t know what to do, I’ve tried coconut oil, a special 25$ shampoo that works okay, even eczema lotion when I got desperate one time. I sectioned my hair carefully to be sure my entire scalp was covered in bio oil, wrapped it up, slept and showered the next day being sure to do a thorough but gentle scrub and good rinse and what. Do. You. Know. My scalp is completely clean and looks perfect. Even when my scalp isn’t dry I don’t think I’ve ever seen it this healthy looking.\n",
            "I am pleased to say I had GREAT results using the product.I had scarring from years of picking ingrown hairs on my beard area, scars on my legs from hiking through bushesand just a few subtle things I saw could use improvement. My results exceeded my expectations. It not only changed the appearance of skins texture, but it faded 75% of the scarring that was plagued my face and body. I usually will put it on my face , neck at night before bed (after washing my face), and its AMAZING on the body right after a shower while still damp. I cant say enough good things about this product. I know results may vary, but I have most favorable results with this one. It is now a household standard.\n",
            "I’ve purchased this product at the drug store and was running low so I had to restock on it. I noticed it was a bit cheaper on Amazon than in the store by a few dollars, which drove me more on purchasing it on here. However, I was a bit hesitant as the reviews were claiming they received a damaged or replica item. I went ahead and purchased it anyway and I was very much pleased with the product. It is in fact an authentic item and the packaging and ingredients, even the scent are identical to the one I purchased in store. So don’t let the reviews drive you away from purchasing. I believe the product changed it’s design.\n"

            "I’ve used this for years!!! I can’t say enough about it! My skin hates everything! This product NEVER upsets my super sensitive face! I can use this when I have allergic reactions and it’s still gentle! It’s hydrating AF and sinks into the skin and absorbs like nobody’s business! I sleep with it overnight if my skins aggravated and it calms down redness and itching. Love this!!! Worth every penny!!! Will always buy this product! It’s a staple and I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone with dry and/or sensitive skin. Works on eczema and dry patches! It’s my all time favorite!\n",
            "LOVE BIO OIL! I have used this oil since the day I became pregnant with my second child, and I refuse to use anything else! I had emergency gall bladder removal at 26 weeks pregnant, and as you can see in my attached photo, the scars are healing tremendously well! I definitely feel the bio oil has improved the healing and scarring!In addition, I am 34 weeks pregnant in the photo, and while I do have stretch marks (white and shiny, old) that are from my previous pregnancy, I STILL have not gotten a single new stretch mark (as I write this review I am now 36weeks + 2days) and bio oil is truly the secret!The oil has a pleasant fragrance, soothes dryness and itchiness, and has sped up the healing from my surgery and reduced scarring. I will always highly recommend this to all my preggo mommy friends!\n",
            "I use this stuff in my regimen to prevent stretch marks in my pregnancies. I use it side by side with a handful of other products (burt’s bees mama bee oil & lotion, palmer’s lotion and vitamin E oil) and haven’t gotten stretch marks on my belly even though I’m genetically predisposed to stretch marks and have them on my thighs and boobs. I’m so happy it’s helped prevent stretch marks on my stomach throughout pregnancy! Started using at about 14 weeks.\n",
            "So I’m using this for pregnancy. So far I have gotten stretch marks all over my body except for my tummy. But I still have 2 months to go so I will probably come back and update. I’ve heard people say that sometimes they appear the last weeks of pregnancy so I’m still expecting some. But I definitely recommend this for any! I even used this on my skin to prevent wrinkles.Update: I’m currently two months postpartum right now and don’t have any stretch marks on my belly. I did forget to apply it after two weeks postpartum and got two very small stretch marks. So basically I got stretch marks everywhere where I didn’t apply the oil and none on my stomach lol\n",
            "Bought this while pregnant because everybody raves about it but I’m almost through the entire bottle and I have not seen a difference in the appearance of the stretch marks I already have and a few new ones crept up while I’ve been using it as well. On top of that, this stuff gets on everything! I have had to use dawn soap to get stains out of clothes from this stuff and it takes so long to dry! Don’t recommend this one.\n",
            "I use this so much! I used it during pregnancy some years ago, but I ordered some to try to help with some dry patches/maskne after the mask mandates. And it totally helped! I even started dabbing some at my smile lines around my eyes and it softens them and gives a youthful glow. I have very sensitive skin and have never had a problem with it\n",
            "I love this stuff. I only use it on uneven skin tones. I am top-heavy and my shoulder straps tend to take it to the skin and cause discoloration. Every morning I put this stuff on those particular areas and they keep my skin tone even. You can tell the difference when you don’t use it as opposed to what you do. It is a great product to use to even your skin tone.\n",
            "This is two days apart! I recently gained a lot of weight very suddenly and was recommended to try this. In only TWO days my stretch marks have gone from a dark dark red/purple to a lighter pink. I can only imagine what they will look like a month from now! Not to mention, my skin has been soooooooo soft.\n",
            "Oh my gosh! I have weird combination skin that pours oil just at the thought of moisturizer. Not to mention that I work in a physically active job so I’m already sweating throughout the day. That being said, I was super skeptical about using an oil anywhere near my face but I had heard good reviews and decided to give it a try. Holy cow! I can’t attest to its use for scars as I haven’t been using it that long but it definitely works as a moisturizer! My skin hasn’t felt this soft and I haven’t gone this long without dry flakes in forever! I use three drops on a cotton ball morning and night after I wash my face and it’s enough to cover my whole face and neck area. I only use foundation for makeup and was super shocked to find that there is absolutely no sheen when I apply it over the oil, and I have noticed an overall lowered oil production level throughout the day!The smell is a little strong but I don’t find it to be a horrible scent and it fades after a few minutes\n",

Even with hyaluronic acid which is supposed to hydrate skin.  Bio-Oil has worked wonderfully and has helped with scars. I use twice a day. Mostly on my face.  My Bio-Oil bottle did not look like the other bottles that people claimed were fake. It has a very light smell. I have clogged hair follicles and therefore really dry bumps.  Was using a prescription medication.  I no longer have to.  Bio-Oil has taken care of the problem just after three days,  twice a day.  I can't say enough good things about it.  As long as it's available it will be a daily part of my routine.\n",
            "The first photo is from Sept. 8, and the second one is Oct. 9. In just one month this stuff has made more progress than anything I’ve ever used. I had terrible scarring from acne caused by an IUD. Finally got it removed and acne went away, but I was left with the scarring. This stuff is a lifesaver. I put it on under my moisturizer in the morning and before I go to bed. My skin looks much brighter and more even. Can’t wait to see the results 6 months from now!\n",
            "I had two surgeries at the beginning of August. My scars healed really well, but they have been a dark purple ever since. They look really bruised. I bought this on January 4, 2021 today is January 20,2021 they have already faded to a lighter purple and are less noticeable. It’s working really well! I have been using the oil on some stretch marks as well, it doesn’t seem to have had the same extreme effect, but I am hopeful. Definitely purchase if you have dark scars. The smell is t great, but it’s not horrible either.\n",
            "Wow! This Bio-Oil is awesome! From the moment I put it on, I could almost hear my skin say \"Thank You!\" My face & skin hasn't felt this soft in such a long time! I've only used it for three days now but my skin is loving it! Would recommend it everyone who's looking for a great product!I will update later on how well it helps with diminishing the scars I have but until then, I'm just going to enjoy the way it has already softened my skin!\n",
            "Bio Oil sounds like an appealing and 'natural' way to reduce a scar on my leg, with different oils, but had I noticed the lisiting for Fragrance (parfum) I would NOT have purchased it.  I've been applying it as instructed for about 3 weeks, and it has lightened the scar just enough that I am optimistic; you supposedly don't see full results for 3 months.  But I cannot stand the stink of it, and I am growing to dislike it more with use.  So if, like me, you are affected by too much fragrance (which, by the way, is chemical and unhealthy, I enjoy products that are scented from botanicals) I would not recommend trying Bio-Oil.  Why so many otherwise good products are over-scented is a mystery, I struggle to find good curly hair conditioners and stying products, and I know from various reviews and speaking with people that intolerance of chemical smells is on the rise.  Gentle botanical scents have a much better affect on your nervous system.  Enough perfume!!\n",
            "Whew...this oil is amazing. I put it on all over as soon as I turn off the shower while still in the tub.  I stand there for a moment to let it absorb, then put on my fluffiest, terry cloth robe and sit for a few minutes with a hot cup of tea. Heaven. Once absorbed, your skin will feel like velvet...for a few days, too, even after a few showers without reapplying.  This oil is pure luxury so get it and pamper yourself like you deserve. I give it as gifts and get rave reviews. Trust me.  You’ll agree.  Not sticky at all and absorbs quickly.\n",
            "So I LOVE this! It rubs on nice and I feel like I dont have to wait too long to pull my pants up over my stomach after applying. Also to scent isn't overwhelming or strong which is great! Been using it for almost 2 months now and still not sick of the smell! But with that said I don't believe I'll buy another bottle bc it doesn't have a pump. Its super inconvenient to have to squirt it out especially if I'm going back for more...If they updated this product with a pump it would be the best. I may repurchase it if the one I got my last two pregnancy is still out of stock (which is why I bought this one in the first place lol) but not sure bc it really does bug me not having a pump. And yes I knew it didn't have a pump when I bought it but didn't think it would be that annoying not to have it.\n",
            "It's very oily. Wherever it's applied, make sure no other things touches it as otherwise it could stain it. I was hoping it has no smell but it smells like perfume. If you like it, good. The reason I bought it was for my recovery cold sore which leaves a patch of redness on my lips. After using it for a couple of weeks, I don't see much improvement at all. Maybe it's just me but at this point, I'm not really convinced.\n",
            "Although I only use it once every night even though it says to use twice. I just rather not be oily twice a day. Still i feel it doesn't hydrate my skin at all. Worked better with a combination of the Burts Bee Momma Butter. The bottle also says that the oil is suppose to be super absorbent but i cant really confirm that since i do it right before bed i'm not sure if it absorbs into my skin or my clothes and blankets. Either way my skin still feels like it wants to tear. I did how ever notice that it helped heal an old gone bad belly button piercing scar. As for my stretch marks from growing up are all still noticeable. Didn't trust it alone to prevent my belly stretch marks thats why i started using the Momma Butter\n",
            "As a first time buyer and the seeing all the reviews claiming this is not genuine BioOil, can only go on personal opinion.This does smell odd for a “natural” product. Reminiscent of Ban du Soliel suntan oil, but sweeter flowery version.I’m not a fan of scented stuff and saw no change in skin, even after applying. After 3rd try, it went in the trash.\n"

On the package, mineral oil is the main ingredient, and I do not like mineral oil. It’s marketed as a herbal oil with plants so it’s very dishonest and misleading to put an ingredient list that is not exactly like the ingredients on the package.\n",
            "This is  a quick absorbing oil with a light, pleasant scent that doesn't linger.  I had high hopes for this as the reviews paint this as something magical.  I had a minor surgery about six months before I bought this and was hoping this would help my scar go away/look less noticeable.  I've been using this for almost a year and my scar looks pretty much the same as it did before.  As I said, I started this about six months after so not sure if it would have made a bigger difference if I started earlier, but for me it hasn't made any difference.\n",
            "Great product. I have acne scars and very dry ankles/elbows... this stuff really hydrates all areas while not overwhelming already oilier areas. I can use this on my face in the t-zone on some deep acne scars and not get a breakout. I also use this in my hair on my scalp to hydrate and help with seasonal climate changes. Its an instant itchy scalp fix, and the scent is gentle but lovely! My boyfriend uses it on the ends of his long hair to help prevent split ends.This is a great oil.Also, you cant find a better price yet on this anywhere else. Ulta is in the 20's and target is around 15 to 18 dollars depending on your area. Order now, this 4.2 ounce large bottle is almost a steal for the benefits this product delivers.\n",
            "This stuff is amazing. I have really sensitive skin and after having my baby my knees took a huge beating. They got these gross calluses on them “housewife knees” and dude I tried everything even polishing them off with a foot exfoliater. I bought this for my face but decided to try on my knees and two days later I realized I didn’t have calluses anymore. Crazy amazing and it smells great.\n",
            "This product is something I can’t live without. The way it moistures and brightens my skin is unbelievable. I have noticed that during winter when I use products around this price range or lower my skin will feel so dry by the end of the day and I’ll need to add more. This is not the case with this oil. It lasts until the next time I shower. I also used to have marks on legs below my knees from how dry my skin used to be. This oil toned them and made them go away. I like it’s smell, but my mom doesn’t so I think it’s not a smell everyone can agree on. It’s not too strong anyway.\n",
            "I bought this to prevent and help heal my stretch marks, but a lot seems off. I use the smallest amount, and it’s still INCREDIBLY oily and never sinks into the skin, and i normally use a regular body oil as a moisturizer. It made me break out in a HORRIBLE rash on ALL of my stretch marks for weeks, even after stopping use it remained and I had to use prescription steroids to make it go away.  I do not have sensitive skin at all and this was the worst reaction ive ever seen! Ive seen reviews that this product is fake, so im going to assume mine was, since it did absolutely nothing but cause me pain and itching. Im going to buy straight from Target for comparison.\n",
            "I wish I had read more reviews for this...what I received was a fake. There wasn't any documentation in the box, no seal on the bottle, it's very runny and smells funny. So disappointing!\n",
            "I used Bio-Oil from my second trimester onward in both of my pregnancies, and it really helps with itching from skin stretching. I did not have stretch marks either time, but I have no idea how much of that is genetic and how much is product. Either way, it’s easy to apply, absorbs pretty quickly, the scent is mild and when I rub the excess onto my knuckles it helps prevent cracks and tears from winter skin—a little goes a long way! This is not a product you need to slather on to get the benefits. I will continue to use Bio-Oil at least during pregnancies and winter. One thing to note, the packaging has changed and with other products that can indicate a quality change, not so with Bio-Oil, the quality is consistently high.\n",
            "I have an allergy to gnats, no-see-ums or midges, and when they bite me (all teeth as you can barely see them, ha!), my skin becomes immediately irritated. I try hard to not scratch, but boy is it hard. Thus, I have scars all over my feet and lower legs. This oil, applied daily, for 1 week, actually started to improve the look of my scars. I use it every day. I still have scars, as they will never go away unless I have lazer, but they do seem to be better. I can at least wear shorts again. Plus, the smell is pleasant, too.\n",
            "I really liked this for the smell and consistency. I had high hopes as I saw a lot of celebrities and youtubers swearing by bio oil. However, it didn’t prevent stretch marks from happening for me as my breasts ballooned at the start of my pregnancy. I will now be using raw Shea butter as I should’ve been doing from the start and maybe mixing some of this oil in with it. But I likely won’t purchase again.\n",

I am grateful for the impact it had on my skin that it was able to come back to normal quickly. I actually applied it all over body. Even my husband noticed that my skin is extra soft and silky. You just have to be persistent in effect will be great. Regardless whether it’s genetic or the effect of the oil, the skin transformation during pregnancy., The fact that the overall effect on body was wonderful makes me very happy.\n",
            "Recently bought this as I am pregnant want to mitigate the scars and stretch marks as much as possible.I love how this feels. It’s definitely moisturizing and leaves my skin so soft, moisturized, and glistening. While it’s oil, I wouldn’t say it leaves me feeling “oily”. It doesn’t leave me feeling wet or gross. Just very moisturized and soft. Love the feel and love how it definitely makes a difference on my skin.I’ve been using it on my scars from previous scrapes or surgeries and it’s definitely reducing the darkness of them as well.\n",
            "I have gotten large stretch marks from the sudden quarantine weight gain. They were a deep purple and I was very self conscious.I noticed a change in color when I used it every day. Now I use it as often as I can (I don't always use it twice a day every day as instructed) but I can still see a difference and a little goes a long way. I was using it all over the area at first, but now I just apple on the stretch marks with my finger tip.\n",
            "I get more and bigger scars from this product. I didn’t know that it is very oily which caused my face to break out. I bought it to help the scars from the white/black heads on my forehead but I didn’t  see any changes. I do not recommend this product to people who get acne from oily skin. It will make it worse.\n",
            "I applied this the my belly while pregnant and it made my skin feel like it was burning. Maybe it prevents stretch marks, but anything that made my skin feel like that I figured might not be good for the baby and I stopped using. I moved on to Burt’s Bees Belly Butter. It felt great on my skin. I gained 49 lbs and not a single stretch mark during my pregnancy. I would recommend that product any day over this bio oil!\n",
            "This is wonderful to keep skin moisturized  I even used it at night time but as for the fact of getting rid of dark spots - no - that didn’t happen\n",
            "I cant stress this enough this product is the best one that I bought off of Amazon yet. I totally see the difference in 2 weeks. My  Acne scars that I had on my face is starting to fade away,  Since I have dry skin this product helps me with that by a lot. I haven't tried it on my stretch marks yet but I'm waiting for the bigger bottle to come in. Listen everyone that is about to buy this amazing product  you NEED the bigger bottle. I am a customer for life.\n",
            "I started using this product every other day from the week I found out I was pregnant. Now at 34 weeks, I have made it almost all the way through with no stretch marks! Full disclosure, I also have made it a priority to drink tons of water each day. I will continue to use this product even after I give birth and have just started using it on the dark spots on my face. It dries quickly, and a little goes a long way. I think the price is very reasonable for the results I've seen.\n",
            "I love this stuff so much and am so grateful the seller offers it at such a reasonable price. CVS sells it for 4x as much so to be able to get such a great product at a much lower price is appreciated! This product is great if you're looking for an everyday serum that won't make you breakout. It's super hydrating and is great to apply before bed, before your night cream or evening moisturizer. I've used similar serums before which lead me to break out and my skin doesn't feel as smooth. This product is very oily so you only need a little bit to go a very long way. It's also great after a day of being in the sun - overall I really feel like I'm taking great care of my skin with this product!\n"

He has sensitive skin and his skin takes to this just fine.He's 14 months and had a fall causing a big scar on his nose. Doc said it'll take up to a year to fully heal and natural oils are great for scars. So we'll see a year from now how it looks.Note: I let the scab heal first before using this product.I use it daily to aid the healing process. His pink scar seems to be fading faster than I expected. So far so good.\n",
            "I really like this oil for my skin and it helps my dry skin.  A family member of mine recently had some minor surgery and when the cut was healed use this oil to help remove the scar, she loves the stuff and it seems to be working well for her.  I also use it on my light scars from bug bites and I do see improvements.  This has to be the 10th bottle I have bought now it has been years.  It has a very interesting smell, I can't pinpoint it, but I like it.  I normally do not like putting oils on myself, but this one is an exception, it feels good and seems to sink into the skin faster.  I don't feel like a grease ball after using it.  I will continue to buy!\n",
            "I rarely leave reviews because who got time for that anyway?However, this oil IS a life changer. It tremendously improved my skin in my chest area. The oil gives it a glow I never experienced before.I started seeing results after a week and a half. I had acne on my chest and shoulders which completely disappeared. Now, the oil is taking care of the scars left. I know that this will take a bit longer however the results are very encouraging. So I would definitely say that it's meant for sensitive skin.I will update this review as I am not trying it on my face and on my thighs.\n",
            "I use this stuff ALL OVER my body. It's great- it's lightweight so I don't feel like I just took a bath in a deep fryer. I can use it on my face without worrying about breaking out (like I often do when using coconut oil), and it leaves my skin soft and glowing. It keeps my hands hydrated at work so I don't have to moisturize 50 times in a day. The smell is a little more floral than I'd like, but it's not overwhelmingly strong so I don't really notice it too much. It sinks in fast so I don't leave greasy fingerprints everywhere. I can't stress enough how great this stuff is.\n",
            "I would bathe in this stuff if I could! It’s amazing! I noticed some really bad stretch marks on my underarms after losing a little weight oddly enough. I’ve been using bio-oil for a few weeks now, twice a day, and I’m already seeing improvements. It’s also taken care of the horrible razor burn and irritation I’ve gotten on my underarms ever since I started shaving. I have always had incredibly sensitive skin, and this hasn’t given me any issues. I’m not crazy about the scent, but it’s not offensive, but not what I would prefer. I will definitely be buying more when I run out.\n",
            "I bought this originally because I wanted to fade some of my stretch marks and to help with dark spots. I have been using this for months now and it has not helped with either the reduction of scar/ stretch mark appearance nor the dark spots. I continued to use it and even purchased a second bottle because it’s a good moisturizer. It smells good and it leaves my skin nice and smooth. I would not give it five stars because it did not help with anything it advertises it would do for the reasons I originally purchased it for.\n",
            "I was scared of the \"this is fake\" reviews so I bought one in store from Target, and one from Amazon. Both had the same smell, texture, color, etc. So from my experience, this listing is legit.To review how it works, I used it every night while I was pregnant with twins. My family history was one of no stretch marks during pregnancy, so that probably helped me, but I also think this product was beneficial. I made it to the bump size of a full term single pregnancy before stretch marks appeared. When they did appear, they were white. I had a few marks appear on my sides at the end of my pregnancy, where I had not been applying nightly oil and those appeared dark and purple.  So I attribute the bump stretch marks being white and much less noticeable to the use of the oil. I thought it smelled really nice and fresh and absorbed decently well. I didn't like using it under my real clothes though because some does transfer to the fabric.\n",
            "I've been using this oil for maybe 4 or 5 days and I already see a huge difference in my facial scars and my belly stretch marks. I use it twice a day, once in the morning, and during my before bed routine. The smell isn't overpowering and a few drops goes a long way. Too much and it'll make your skin feel too greasy and heavy. I have extremely sensitive skin and this oil does not cause me to have any type of reaction to it. It leaves my skin feeling moisturized and soft all day. I will definitely buy more when I get low.\n",
            "I love this stuff so far. Using it since about 16 wks on my preggo belly at night time. Skin feels hyrdrated still when I wake up. I’ve barley used 1/2 a bottle and am currently 30weeks. Might start using elsewhere now that I know a little goes a long way. Somewhat grease upon initial application  but gets better once all rubbed in. Not really a scent to it which is fine with me since I am only using it at night.\n",
            "I really love bio oil and how it soaks into your skin not leaving it greasy. I have seen amazing things with this. My girlfriend has used it for years! She had deep stretch marks and discoloration in her face. I have seen a difference for sure! I started using it about a week ago. I have extremely sensitive dry skin. This doesn’t burn or irate my skin at all. Smells nice! Not over powering. Helped toned down my redness. Haven’t used it long enough to see if my stretch marks are better. I’ll update in a few months about that.\n",

            "Application is much more convenient than lotions or thicker products. The smell is AMAZING. I've been using this twice a day since towards the end of my 1st trimester (about a month into my 3rd now) & not a single stretch mark anywhere! Even my doctor complimented me on how great my skin has been . Would work well for anyone. My skin is very sensitive, even most \"sensitive\" & non scented 'natural' laundry soaps make me break out, but this stuff hasnt given me a problem ever. I love it.\n",
            "I really like the way it absorbs. I will probably use this until a few months after my pregnancy mainly because it feels really good on my sensitive,  stretching skin. .. the only downside is it smells terrible! It smells like old parfum blended inbaby oil. I would suggest also using a good body butter about 30 min. after applying.  This oil absorbs alot.. but this is what I need. Its important to moisturize all the layers of skin durring pregnancy\n",
            "I highly recommend this product, I struggled with acne in a certain area of my body & I tried everything and anything to get ride of it & the scares for a very long time. Not even a dermatologist could help with me. I used it everyday after the shower for about a few months and it worked amazing, all scars gone. My acne completely gone & never came back. That was 6 years ago, I still use it to this day forward just for stretch marks now, but I stopped using this product for a little bit and the acne didn’t return! So totally worth buying it! Small bottle can be found at a local store but not the big bottle, buying the big bottle on here is better and saves you money. The big bottle last for a long time.\n",
            "I have Sjogren’s which is an autoimmune disorder making my skin extremely dry. I used this on my face as soon as I received it and ohhhh, the scent is absolutely wonderful! It is an oil, so at first there is an oily feel and sheen. Then after a bit, it totally absorbed into my skin making it feel very soft and smooth. I’m not as concerned about scars or discoloration but if it helps reduce the brown spots from hormones, I would consider it a bonus!! It does what I ordered it for... purely moisturizing my super dry skin. Awesome 😊\n",
            "Love bio oil. Use it for my face as it’s a non comedogenic (it doesn’t clog pore & cause breakouts) provides the extra moisturizer you need in a face oil. Will put it on after my lotion layer. Also works great on body with scars & stretch marks as I’ve used it in the passed to fade my transplant scar across my belly.\n",
            "Smells nice, like medicine. Arrived in Good condition. Tested it out on my skin and it was Oil, not watered down or tampered with.It clearly says “in the unlikely event of skin irritation, discontinue use” FYI so Ignore the negative reviews about skin outbreaks. Read instructions and ingredients first.Anyway, I will give update about if it works and with results within the next 3 months.\n",
            "WIth my first pregnancy, I started using this product as early as my first trimester. I used this product every day after showering and am stretch mark free on my belly. My mother didn't get stretch marks when she was pregnant with me and my brothers so I also credit having good genes as to why I'm not as prone to them. Bio-Oil has a great scent to it and I noticed that it does help with uneven skin tone. My 1yr old son has a bit of eczema on his foot and after rubbing a little bit of this oil on the affected site after his bath, I noticed a big difference in the morning. I am currently pregnant with my second and am continuing to use this product again. I'm almost done with my 2nd bottle 16.7 ounce bottle and am about 24 weeks pregnant as we speak! Especially with the dry summers, the oil helps to hydrate my skin. I would highly recommend this product to expecting mothers.\n",
            "I started using this about half way through my pregnancy and it’s been about a week & a half since I got it. I have used it every day since then and had previous stretch marks from my last pregnancy 5 years ago and began getting more this time around. The marks are fading SO FAST including my old ones and I love the smell. I even started using it on my face and have noticed a more even skin tone already! Will be purchasing again! LOVE IT!\n",
            "I've been using Bio Oil for a while now and it is the only thing that I noticed actually diminish my scars and made me skin look and feel great. (I use it with Aveeno lotion). It does have a light smell that I like, isn't too oily and soaks into the skin instead of just sitting on top of it. It says on its own instructions to use twice a day, I only put it on after a shower (while my skin is still warm) so it'll soak into my pores of my skin. It took away stretch marks  on my hips and shoulders and diminished scars on my legs, also helped with overall appearance and softness and smoothness of my skin!!\n",
            "This scent smells amazing! I was skeptical about this product. I’ve heard from others that it works, but I just didn’t believe it. I suffer from HS and have scarring as a result, especially under my arms. I refuse to wear sleeveless shirts because of my insecurities, but now I’m ready for the summer! Bring the sleeveless shirts and dresses on! I’ve been using this product for only a few weeks. I apply it 2x’s a day and have seen great improvements with my scarring. It’s a great moisturizer and is great for anyone with sensitive skin.\n"

I can't stand perfume. I love essential oils so its not the scent - its that it is clearly a chemical perfume. I also happen to know how bad they are for you to wear chemical fragrance. SO I think I'll give up and go to a plain organic oil.\n",
            "I tend to pick at my skin, especially on my face, if I have a pimple or blemish. I read online that Bio-Oil heals small wounds quickly so I thought it might help me. It is absolutely perfect for what I need. I apply it once or twice a day when needed (using a cotton pad) and it heals my skin sooo quickly without causing clogged pores or acne.I didn’t find it as fast-absorbing as others but I don’t mind and actually find that having a thin layer or this on my skin keeps me from touching the area. Would definitely recommend!\n",
            "See photos.... within 2 days of using this product my hyperpigmentation caused by intense TCA 25 % peel , started to peel off my skin. I have posted photos to prove that... 2 days!! Hyperpigmentation takes months of rigorous skin care protocol to lighten. Sunscreen is a MUST... never skip the sunscreen.. the sun darken the skin.. you are riding a hamster wheel if you skip sunscreen. Where it everyday for the rest of your life. Include your chest and hands. This is a miracle product! But not without : SUNSCREEN\n",
            "I purchased this as soon as I found out I was pregnant to help with stretch marks. I started using this product in the second trimester as instructed. I used this in conjunction with a stretch mark cream by Medela and didn't develop any stretch marks until around 30 weeks. They say stretch marks are mostly due to genetics, so I can't say I blame this for getting them. Even after developing stretch marks, this does help some with the itchiness due to my skin stretching. I'm on my second bottle now. While I can't say it completely prevents stretch marks, I do feel that it does help some with the appearance of them. The only down side is that this does have a slight scent. It doesn't bother me but it's definitely noticeable. It also takes a little bit of time or a lot of rubbing to fully absorb, so it's not something you can quickly slap on and go.\n",

            "39 weeks pregnant and amazing results! Absolutely recommend.Update pictures 6 weeks pregnant and 38, my pregnancy ended at almost 41.All the women of my family have a ton of stretch marks ( I mean A LOT) and I was trying to fight the genetic 😁.3 weeks POSTPARTUM  AND NO STRETCH MARKS AT ALL!!!!!I used BIO OIL every morning since I find out I was pregnant ( a gooood amount) and at night-Organic Shea Butter by Sky Organics-. And drinking a lot of water.After delivery I continued doing it and I will until my body goes back 100%.So happy with the results\n",
            "This oil works! I use it on my face and body everyday. It lightened my stretched mark and scars! I used it on my arms and it also lightened my tan line! I put some on my face too after lotion and my face is brighter and a lot of my dark spots faded too! Absolutely love it!\n",
            "I've been using this my whole pregnancy, 39 weeks with no stretch marks. Could be genetics as people say but I have stretch marks on my butt and thighs from HS growth spurt. I will say this oil does nothing for old stretch marks.  If you can get it from SAMS you'll get a much better price but we don't have a Sam's near us, just Costco who doesn't carry this anymore.\n",
            "Some reviews say that this isn’t the original product or that it’s a knock off but the product I got seems to be the real deal and works well! I have acne scars on my chest that I want to reduce and eventually remove and this oil has been a great start! I use it on my face as well! It smells really good too. At first I wasn’t too sure about the smell just because smelling it out of the bottle I couldn’t quite put my finger on what the scent was but when you apply it it smells wonderful. I use it as a moisturizer as well and it works well for rough and bumpy skin on my arms. Well worth the price and a tiny bit of the oil goes a long way!\n",

            "As a nurse in surgery, I see a lot of incisions and skin wounds.  A plastic surgeon recommended bio oil to a friend with scars and we tried it.  People with dark complexion and blended skin tones this could help.  My daughter scars easily making a change to the brown pigment.  A stick scratched her while playing in the yard and over a year later it looks like she has used brown marker on herself.  It takes several weeks to see it fade but worth it.  I don’t know if the scar will completely be gone or come back when she gets a little sun.\n",
            "Bio- oil ? Are you kidding me?  This oil isn't even made with ANY kind of biologic oil. It's made with Mineral oil !GLARING PROBLEM ! I'm not surprised that it did absolutely no good whatsoever.\n",
            "Not sure why this product has to have all the chemicals and preservatives listed on the box?It’s a nice combination of oils - but there is a multitude of chemicals - fragrance and red dye too.The choice is yours - my question is why the fragrance and why the dye and chemicals?\n",
            "So I’ve only been using this for about a week on my tummy (14 months postpartum, lost 80 pounds, stretch marks and sagging skin) and I swear I’ve already noticed a difference. It’s thin like oil (obviously) but it sticks like lotion and it’s amazing. It’s smell is similar to shaving cream which I personally really like. It does leave your hands a little oily even after rubbing in but I don’t mind washing my hands after. Definitely worth the money so far since it’s the only thing I’ve used that even has kind of made a difference.\n",
            "I had heard great things about this oil for reducing and preventing stretch marks during pregnancy.  I added it to my subscribe and save order after running out of a different kind of belly butter.  After 2 days of use (morning and evening) I broke out in a horrible itchy/painful rash over my belly and hips where I had been using it.  My skin is still irritated and red/bumpy/itchy over a day later, after discontinuing use.  While it may work for some, there must have been something in it that didn't agree with my skin.  I'm now stuck with the rest of the bottle and no use for it.\n",
            "So I’ve been using this oil daily on my breasts and my belly during my pregnancy. On those areas I have not even ONE stretch mark. My skin looks great. But on the side/back of my hips I have a few little ones, though I know I haven’t applied it at all there as I didn’t think of it. My conclusion is that this product has prevented a lot of stretch marks on my skin! Love it! Bought it more to see now if it will do anything to the ones i got where i didn’t apply before and update this review in the future.\n",
            "Compré este aceite porque pensé que me iba a ayudar a que no me salieran estrías en el embarazo pero no funcionó. Igual me salieron estrías por mucho que me colocaba el aceite todos los días. El aceite tiene buena fragancia pero en mi opinión si lo compras para que te ayude a disminuir la apariencia de tus estrías o que te ayude a que no te salgan, no vale la pena. O al menos no para mi. Si lo compras porque te gusta hidratar tu piel con aceites y piensas que esto te puede ayudar, bien.\n",
            "Seriously can’t rave enough about this oil. Soaks in well, great scent, and does amazing thing for skin. I moved to the Midwest from the South and started developing stretch marks in the winter due to the dry air. This makes my skin feel great and reduced the appearance of the marks I hard and reversed the marks that were red and starting. Recommended this to someone who was pregnant, she used it and no belly stretch marks! Take it easy on the face as too much can make you break out, but for whatever reason you’re thinking you want to buy this product and try it, it’s worth it. You will thank yourself later.\n",
            "De verdad funciona y se nota en las pocas semanas ... lo único que cuando lo dejas de usar se empiezan a marcar otra vez aunq ya no como al principio pero aún se notan\n",
            "I honestly could cry. I gain a lot of weight cause I was struggling with the news of my mom getting cancer and in the process I got stretch marks. This stuff started showing results just after the first time using it. I have gained so much confidence back seeing my stretch marks disappear during my weight loss journey. I also use a derma roller after I apply which I think helps a lot. I highly recommend this product for anyone who wants to get rid of stretch marks\n"

Not only is it good to prevent stretch marks (I used everyday in pregnancy and didn’t get any). It’s also great for razor burn- I put on my legs after shaving and don’t get the itchy bumps like usual. I also use it on my face. Light scent that’s not overpowering and it’s not super oily like coconut oil. So happy I found this!\n",
            "Works great for stretch marks. I used during pregnancy to prevent stretch marks and didn’t have a single one (and I’m prone to them- I have them from puberty).Only con is that the oil does take a while to soak in and can stain clothes\n",
            "I have only used it once and I love the scent and feel of the oil. It also absorbs into the skin pretty quickly and doesn't leave the skin feeling sticky, just soft and moisturized. I got it to help with uneven skin tones, scars, and stretch marks so I obviously don't have any results for that but I will come back at a later time to post my review for it diminishing marks on the body, I am taking pics to show progress.\n",
            "I bought this  after reading many reviews, and am very happy that I did. After having foot surgery my foot was extremely dried out and the incision areas looked just awful. I applied this to my foot and over the healed over incisions and it has worked wonders. I use it at least once a day, and also use on my other foot that was kind of dried out too. My healing foot I have also done Epson Salt soaks and that helped to initially remove a lot of dead skin. Both my feet look so much better. I recommend this product, and will most likely buy more when this bottle runs out to keep my feet looking supple and healthier.\n",
            "I got this oil to try for my husband's persistent seborrheic dermatitis.  Nothing we have tried has worked, consistently.  His outbreaks are so spontaneous, usually related to stress.  So it's a constant battle to keep him from looking like freak with all the redness and oily flaking. Usually takes 3-4 days to clear up with vitamin C serum, etc.Got the Bio-Oil.  Overnight success!  Finally we have a solution to the ongoing problem!  His sensitive skin seems to love the Oil.  So now I'm using it,too!  Will be helpful if it can help me circumvent all the expensive skin creams.Thank you, Bio-Oil, and all who wrote reviews here that convinced me to try it!\n",
            "The pros:  this stuff really works.  It has made my skin absolutely beautiful.  It has faded scars and stretchmarks, makes it super soft and silky, and it gives my skin a beautiful glow.  I have really noticed a huge difference.  The cons:  the smell.  I feel like it is overly-perfumed.  It's not necessarily a bad smell, and it goes away pretty quickly, especially once I put clothes on, but I don't think it needs to be as strongly scented as it is.  I would absolutely LOVE it if Bio-Oil came out with an unscented version.  But since it works so well, I will continue to use it every day.\n",
            "The reason I had purchased this product was because I have scars on my arm that I’ve been trying to get rid off. I used it as directed, it did help moisturize my skin, but I felt it was greasy, which I didn’t like (but I guess that’s kind of my fault for buying an oil of course it’s going to be oily) other than my skin looking more moisturized, I didn’t really see any other results, which is a bummer, but onto the next too find what will help with my skin.\n",
            "I've used this product before, and absolutely love it. I'd recommend this to anyone to help with scars or stretch marks. Not too oily; absorbs well into the skin, but I always put it on and leave it for a while and then rub it in again before putting clothes on. I've never had oil marks on my clothes doing it this way, or on my sheets if I put it on before bed. BUT, I don't lather it on thick, so I'm not sure what would happen if you did.\n",
            "Heads up for ingredient-conscious pregnant ladies: Bio-oil contains retinyl palmitate. I won't be using this during my pregnancy, and I'm pretty shocked at how heavily marketed it is toward pregnant women. While topical retinoids are not proven to cause birth defects the same as oral retinoids, doctors still routinely recommend that we avoid them entirely. Maybe save this for postpartum if you really want to use it.\n",
            "Bio oil is great, Zero stretch marks during pregnancy, and my belly was huge!Also I am currently treating my legs for varicose veins. Vein ablation and sclerotherapy.  And due to the treatment my legs started to show discoloration just where they treated the vein my doctor recommended to use bio oil to help with the discoloration.  I have noticed that they are getting better, but discoloration is still there. Hopefully it goes away very soon.\n",

Vitamin E also increases the moisture content of the epidermis, making the skin soft, smooth and supple.PurCellin Oil™: Reduces the thickness of the formulation, improving smoothness and ease of application, making Bio-Oil readily absorbed by the skin.

            "I'm 74 years old and have been using this for over a year......best night time moisturizer I have found!  I have multiple allergies and have sensitive skin.\n",
            "Bought this to rub on my teenager’s back. He’s growing and gaining weight and got stretch marks on his back. So far, they’re getting lighter sonI definitely see a difference.Also, I’ve been using this on my face as a moisturizer at night and it’s been doing wonders. I have sensitive skin and rosacea sonI can’t use just anything, but I thought why not try - and I love it! My face looks so much cleaner and smoother now!*What might work for me, might not work for others, so be cautious using this on your face.\n",
            "BUYER BEWARE!!!! I read a few negative reviews about this exact product before purchasing it but I didn’t listen and bought it anyway. I should have just bought it at Walmart like I always do but I didn’t want to expose myself due to COvid 19. Anyway, big mistake!! This product is counterfeit and used!! The bottle I received was all scratched up everywhere and the liquid was clearer than usual. I’m SURE this is fake bio oil and I’m returning it ASAP. DO NOT BUY!!!!\n",
            "I honestly usually don't post reviews, but by far this product went above and beyond my expectations. I noticed some unsightly red stretch marks a few months ago, and honestly stretch marks usually do not bother me, but months after they were still red and there. I didn't look into alternatives to help me get rid of them later until I wanted to go swimming. And to be honest I wasnt looking to spend that much money on them. This was an absolute bang for my buck. My stretch marks had dulled down to a deep red and within THREE DAYS the stretch marks had subsided back to my skin color and was on the verge of disappearing. Do not doubt this product. Although I may have been one of the few cases where the product took miraculously well, it could very well work really well for you too! I read a few reviews about how it smells bad but Its like an herbal scent that I dont really mind. Overall, the product delivered beyond my expectations especially considering what I paid for. i always thought treatment for stretch marks would be expensive and ineffective; this product has blown my mind.\n",
            "I regret not taking thé before and after pictures. But I have been using this product for I think 2-3 weeks and from week 1 I could tell a difference from the appearance of my stretch marks. I am African American  and I decided to use this oil as my lotion. It was just fine too. I think I will stick to this.Compared to all other stretch mark product I’ve used in th le past this one definitely works. I have the darker ( or purple ) stretch marks so those are kinda hard to go but this made my stretch marks to reduce and I feel more confident wearing some clothes that show off some skin.\n",
            "It moisturizes because of the rich mineral oil. It plugged my pores. It cause more pigmentation on skin. It has full of perfumes. It's not good for sensitive skins. It just a marketing wonder. I would not recommend this brand to anybody. Please, use your money for better products.\n",
            "One of my girlfriend spoke highly of this oil.  So I thought, \"what do I have to lose?\"  In my 2nd trimester of pregnancy, I started applying the oil morning and night.  I kept this regiment up all the way through to day my daughter was due.  I am very pleased with the results.  No stretch marks!  I definitely recommend this product for all soon to be moms out there.I still have some left over and will try it on my existing stretch marks to see how that does.  More comments to come...\n",
            "I love bio-oil but the package I received was sketchy so I am returning it. It has been opened and then resealed with clear tape. This is NOT okay for something I am putting on my body. No way to know if it is the right product or had been tampered with. It is suppose to be a NEW product, not used!!!\n"

            "I really wish I had taken before and after photos when I first started using this, but I have taken some now and I'll try to update later.  It really does help with scars. I've been using it on my face for a few months every night. I wasn't sure if it would work, but it was a great moisturizer. I have really bad breakouts on my right chin all the time with lots of discoloration. I wasn't expecting anything great, and it took a few months, but the difference is incredible. The discoloration is almost gone and it had been there for years. Don't know if it will work on raised scars or stretch marks but it's worth trying. Also, totally safe to use on your face.\n",
            "Someone recommended this so I ordered it and LOVE it!  It has a light scent that doesn't overpower and it doesn't leave you feeling oily or greasy.  I put it on my body after showering and my son just told me that he has used it on his face while showering and then lightly rinses it and likes it as well. It keeps my skin from feeling itchy in the MN winter.  I do put lotion on after drying before clothes, but this keeps me moisturized all day.\n",
            "FAKE!! I received my package and it was already opened but taped shut. Seriously? Do NOT BUY THIS. The original Bio-Oil is great but this is a S. C. A. M.\n",
            "When I first purchased I was concerned about what it was going to smell like after reading all the reviews saying it smelled horrible. First thing I did when I got it is smell it and it does NOT SMELL BAD. Seriously. I personally enjoy the subtle smell of lavender and chamomile. It literally smells like essential oils. If that’s not your preference then I guess don’t purchase. It doesn’t leave you looking super greasy but it does leave a very subtle glow and leaves my skin feeling  soft. I personally paired it with another cream for extra hydration. I will update after i’ve used it for a longer time to see if it works well alone.\n",
            "I bought it two months of my c section and have been using it for the past two months. But my stretch marks are still turning from pink to dark purple which is quite obvious on the belly. Perhaps I should continue to use it for another month but for now I really cannot see its effectiveness. It is quite greasy and I have to uncover my belly for about half an hour to let it dry. The only thing I like about it is the smell. Some reviewers complained about it but I actually like the light scent.\n",
            "This oil has been amazing for my stretch marks!! Their color and appearance has vastly improved since I began using it, and since then I have also noticed I have not gotten anymore on my belly and thighs. I’m in the third trimester of my first pregnancy, and I am so glad I was recommended this product! I have pupps rash, and I do believe this has helped since adding it to my skin care routine\n",
            "Bio-Oil is the BEST skin product on the market. I use it as a twice a day, morning and before i go to bed. Small lines have disappeared. My skin is very smooth and seems to glow. A doctor recommended this to one of my friends who told me about it. I have bought several bottles as gifts.. Be patient. It will take a few months for you to see notice the changes. Works well for Pregnant women help with stretch marks and scares I been use this product for over 4 years\n",
            "I wanted to like this soooooo badly, as it's worked for my mom and grandma for smoothing their skin. I have dry skin so I got excited to try it. It broke my chin out with rashy pimples 2 weeks into using it. Haven't been able to get rid of the rashy pimples yet (another 2 weeks later) and I even stopped using it. I must have extremely sensitive skin and I think it just clogged my pores perhaps. My mom and grandma would rate it a 5 though for anyone wanting to hear their opinion.\n",
            "Been using for about 4 months and have used it religiously for my first pregnancy. I started using before my stretch marks came in. When they did it was very minimally. However with my stomach being about 4ft around which is over double what it was it’s pretty inevitable that I’d get some sort of stretch marks. I use this product once to twice a day. Some days I’ve just used straight coconut oil which I have noticed doesn’t do anything but moisturize. Bio oil actually soothes my irritated skin and prevents future irritation while also repairing. I can absolutely see a difference between issuing coconut oil for a few days and than using bio oil ONCE even after a couple min! I will update with post later with a picture for reference. I am giving 4 stars because it doesn’t prevent stretch marks completely but I am very impressed with how well it’s helped in comparison to how big my stomach has grown. I highly recommend this product!\n",

            "First, I am usually a person that makes my own lotion to avoid cheap fillers. I am not a fan of mineral oil in moisturizer. This product does contain mineral oil. I make a little bit of an exception here, because this product goes on very smoothly, the scent is nice, and the oily residue is absorbed fairly quickly, comparative to similar products. It is too early to tell if it will have an effect on scars or not, but a little bit seems to go along way and I will continue to use.\n",
            "I LOVE THIS! I bought two different oils, when I ordered this. The other oil cane cracked and the packaging sucked. This product though, oh my lanta... it smells so good! I found it at my local drug store, so I purchase it there too!\n",
            "This is like my go to stretch mark oil. After 3 kids, I surprisingly did not have very many stretch marks at all but I still used this for the 3 deep stretch marks I had and it has made them fade. You can still notice them but I was not using it faithfully either. My kids are now 10, 4, and 3, and I still use this on occasion. I've been using it off and on for 10 years! And it smells so great!\n",
            "I know they say stretch marks are mainly genetics. Neither my mom nor sister developed stretch marks during pregnancy, however, they also weren’t pregnant with twins; unlike me! I used this stuff RELIGIOUSLY morning & night as soon as I found out I was pregnant up until I got back down to my pre-pregnancy weight. I did not develop a SINGLE stretch mark. Note that in the photo of me in the bikini was at about five months. I ended getting up to 172 and I was huge and honestly too embarrassed of my naked belly so I never photographed it, which I now regret. 2nd photo is post-pregnancy. Still some extra skin but NO stretch marks! While using this product I did break out very badly on my stomach with acne. But I think that’s a side effect I can live with given the results I ended up with\n",
            "Pros:- I bought the oil to use on my scars. I usually use mederma but it was getting to be very expensive because I was going through those small tubes of gel very quickly. This bottle is really lasting me a long time because I only need a few dabs of oil on my specific scars.- My scars have been actually fading. They’re not completely gone but I can tell that they are a lot harder to see than before.Cons:- The scent is a bit unique. It’s not overpowering but I think I can do without it.*For reference, I did not apply this to face. I only applied it to my legs and arms.\n",
            "Winter in Wisconsin is not kind to the skin. My legs get so dry and itchy but I put this on after a shower and they look and feel great. No more scratching my legs until they bleed! I also use this product on my face and it seems to even out the skintone. Has a nice smell too. Makes my skin feel so soft after it is absorbed into the skin. I ordered this product after seeing it on the Morning Show and Jenna Bush said she used the same for stretch marks.\n",
            "I’m certain this product isn’t real, or it’s been diluted. First all, it did not come with a safety seal. The bottles I purchased at CVS, Target and other retail stores come with a safety seal, and the smell is wonderful. However, this bottle lacks the same smell and consistency...it doesn’t feel as oily as my other bottles I’m used to. I will be returning this product and would not recommend getting it from Amazon.\n",
            "I am so in love. I am multi race woman (which I love ;) and get really dry skin in the winter, and on top of that I am 5 months pregnant!! I’ve been using this oil all over my body and my face since I’ve been 3 months pregnant and let me tell you!! The best! Being pregnant your skin can get very itchy as it’s stretching and this soothes and hydrates my skin like no other. I also put this on when my skin is dry and it absorbs perfectly leaving no oily residue after application.I am also very voluptuous and my current stretch marks and blotches have diminished significantly! Hands down my favorite oil and will continue to use even after my pregnancy.So grateful for you guys thank you!!\n",
            "Not a fan of the scent. In my opinion, it has an \"old lady\" type of smell to it. My husband even commented on it the first few times I used it. Despite the scent, the oil is very moisturizing and I continue to use this on a daily basis. Results were almost immediate and the good news is the scent does seem to disappear after a little while\n",
            "Whether or not you get stretch marks is entirely genetic. I knew I would get stretch marks with pregnancy since I already had them on my legs. I’ve been using bio oil about every other day and a bump cream the other days. I still got stretch marks but I will say that the bio oil definitely helps with the itchiness compared to a cream or lotion. I gave it 5 stars because I believe it works as it should even though it didn’t prevent my stretch marks (impossible). It moisturizes well. I plan on using it postpartum too.\n"

I also occasionally use it on dry spots on my face and it does amazing things! It moisturizes quickly and absorbs into the skin well so it doesn’t leave a really oily feeling, for me at least. I highly suggest this oil to everyone💖\n",
            "Like other reviewers mentioned, not sure if this is a fake or not. I've used it continuously every day for three months on two small scars. The scars are about six months old. I used generous amounts on each scar, let it dry before putting on clothes. There has been no improvement, no lightening, nothing. The smell is nice, but honestly this was a waste of money as there's no changes. Congrats to everyone that did see improvement, but this was useless for me.\n",
            "Bought this for my TT surgery and works great on scars. I also found out that it works to heal burns very quickly as well. Had grease splatter on my face and had some small 2nd degree burns. This stuff cut the healing time in half for me and the burns went away within days. Now I use it on every skin ailment that comes by me lol\n",
            "Bought my first bottle years and years ago for a friend with a surgery scar *wanna say 2008?). Had seen an ad in a magazine for it and thought he might like it. Started using it on my face ever since - thinking if it was good for scars I would try it on wrinkles ahaha - who knows if it's really good for that). I remember writing to the company about it but hearing no reply. I honestly do get so many compliments that people are surprised by how old I am - they all say I look ten years younger. I exercise, drink a ton of water, don't drink or smoke, and use BioOil as my moisturizer - no joke. I recommend and hope it is helpful.\n",
            "I do not have sensitive skin so I’m not sure if this would react with those who have sensitive skin however, I found it heavily perfumed. I try to avoid heavy fragranced skin care products especially since I ordered this to dermaroll/micro needling. It felt pleasant on the skin and seemed to absorb quickly. If this oil had a more faint/natural scent I would be happier. Apart from that I think it’s fine.\n",
            "Smells great. Got rid of my stretch marks so quickly and cellulite. Was super insecure about them and now I feel much better. Also helped decrease the look of harsh scars. I think it helps my acne too maybe? I did break out in an irritated red reaction on my chest tho. This isn’t my first bottle. So it’s overall great\n",
            "This stuff works like no other product out there. However, this is not real bio oil. Next time I won't be so lazy and I'll just go to cvs! The box was open and the botle wasn't sealed. I have been using this for years, the real one. This one I bought on amazon is thin has a different scent and doesnt look anything like my other bottle.The plastic bottle is even thinner. Buy elsewhere.\n",

Aside from my breasts, I'll be using this Bio-Oil on my belly and thighs to help prevent other stretch marks from appearing.I plan on updating this review throughout my pregnancy. Really have high hopes for this product going by the reviews!03/05: Sadly, I'm going to have to stop using this product. Rashes have formed in the areas where I've applied this oil. The worst ones were on my breasts where I've applied the most oil. Maybe I used too much product? Either way, I'm going to use coconut oil in place of the Bio Oil. At least until my rashes go away and I'll try again at a later date.\n",
            "I’ve been using this product everyday for a little under 2 months. At first, I was afraid I wasn’t going to like putting oil on my face, but it’s not so bad. It gives your skin a dewy look, which is nice. Although I haven’t seen any significant changes in my skin tone and stretch marks, it’s a REALLY good moisturizer. It didn’t make me break out, and doesn’t sting when I apply it, which usually happens with other moisturizers. My skin is very oily, and this product hasn’t really changed my skin’s oil production.\n",
            "I don’t have an authentic bottle to compare this to so I won’t know if it’s real or not and also have never used it, but this thing made me very itchy and got hives on my new incision scar. It turned so red it’s almost purple. Horrible!!!\n",

            "This paired with dermarolling is the only reason my deep thick stretch marks are improving. They were a dark dark purple and now are a purple red. Massive improvement. I literally cried when someone commented on noticing the difference because I was so happy!\n",
            "Bio oil has helped me immensely. I’ve purchased the big bottle 3 times. I first began using it for a surgery scar on my knee. It faded a lot, to the point that it’s not noticeable anymore. Then, for a medical condition I had to take steroids on and off for months which gave me purple stretch marks because I gained weight fast. They were all up and down my inner legs and now, most have faded or at the very least look lighter after about 2 months of use. I find that the best way to apply this stuff is twice a day and to leave it on for at least 20 minutes. Let it soak into your skin! Give it time. It works very well for me! Would recommend for scars and stretch marks\n",
            "I have horribly dry skin and then moved to the desert. Ugh. Regular water based moisturizers just don’t cut it. I started using this as an oil on my face. It absorbs well, improves my skin tone and helps to smooth on my foundation or tinted moisturizer/ sunblock. It hasn’t clogged my pores or given me any breakouts. I’ve used it for over a year now. If your skin is dry like an alligator and needs some soothing/healing, give this a try.\n",
            "I am so in love with this product. I mean within the 1st 2 weeks I noticed a difference. I have been using it a little over 3 months and now I'm addicted. I have to have it on fresh out the shower while still wet daily. It has definitely place an evenly beautiful skin tone for my entire body. When I read it was okay to put it on my face, which I have sensitive skin, omg it makes me look amazing. My daughter got me to use this product as she was only using it for her buttocks🤭. When I told her I use it on my entire body including my ears, she started doing the same thing. Then I started telling her how beautiful her face was forgetting she started using this on her face. The disadvantage of the product is that my skin is ashy by the end of the day but that's doesn't stop me from using it. Now I have it on auto-purchase. I am extremely happy as a Black Woman.\n",
            "Bought this product for my sister! I used it a couple years back for stretchMarks and it worked super well! I got a little rash at first but my skin is super sensitive! Would definitely recommend if you are trying to get rid of or lessen the appearance of stretchmarks! Works well and the scent is really good! It does not leave your skin dry!\n",
            "I use it for my belly to prevent stretch marks after I got pregnant. It's not the easiest oil to be used as it's really thick. I find it easier to apply if you don't dry your body completely. With a little water remind, it's the best time to apply it. So far I have not yet seen any stretch marks. Not sure it's bcoz of bio-oil or my body type. I would say it's not a bad product but it takes time for you to adjust the way it applies\n",
            "I have been a Bio Oil for many years so I am very familiar with this product.  What I received in no way is the real product.  The scent and texture were nothing like the real product.  Plus, the product did not have a anti-tampering seal on the bottle.  Clearly, the fake product I received had been used. Returned for a refund.\n",
            "I received this in my Amazon baby box, and I ended up switching from using Palmer's cocoa butter to this for stretch marks prevention. Now I know skin is different and this product may not be 'the miracle' but I do not have one single stretch marks at 36 weeks pregnant. I slathered this stuff on my belly, hips and breasts every single night minus maybe 5 nights because I fell asleep early. It smells wonderful and doesn't leave an overly oily residue. It soaks in just right. I also used it on some solar dermatitis that I got on my hands and it cleared it right up.\n",
            "Ok, I have only had this product for a couple of days so I cant speak for its efficacy over the long term, but I can say that this oil is deep penetrating, and relieves itchiness associated with pregnancy belly growth.  That being said, holy cow, that scent.  It's quite strong, and I can only describe it as that old perfume smell that circulates around a group of grandmas when they are in a group.  I dont mean to be rude or belittle any grandma, but there is a distinct too much and to many smells that is kind of the grandma essence.  This company has somehow bottled that and jacked it up to an 11.  Personally, I prefer earthy scents so this one is a bit difficult to use especially first thing in the morning, so take that for what it's worth I guess.\n",
            "I’m a nurse and my hands are destroyed from washing them, thanks to our friend COVID. I have been slathering them in anything I can find to help... nothing makes any difference UNTIL I received this in the mail last night. Two applications later my hands are at least 50% better. It smells nice too.\n"

            "This stuff is AMAZING! A little bit goes a looooong way, and the moisturizing factor is off the charts! It doesn’t say to use it on lips, but my chronically chapped and peeling lips... after just ONE use... are now soft and beautiful. I’m just stunned. I’ve put it on my beginning forehead wrinkles and it softened them immediately.I. ADORE.  THIS.  MIRACLE.  OIL.\n",
            "I USED THIS THE ENTIRE TIME I WAS PREGNAT AND IM SO GLAD I DID. I WENT BACK AND FORTH WITH THIS AND COCO BUTTER. IT REALLY HELPED AND WETHER IT WAS THIS PRODUCT OR JUST GOOD GENES, I DIDNT GET ANY STRETCH MARKS. SO THANK FUL. I ALSO USE THIS TO MOISTURIZE  MY FACE AT NIGHT ( KEEP AWAY FROM EYES) WHICH I FEEL HELPS WITH DELAYING THOSE WRINKLES. I ALWAYS GET COMPLMENTS ON MY SKIN. I ALSO USE IT FOR MY NECK AND HANDS. IT DID CLEAR UP SOME UN EVEN TONES ON MY FACE. IM PRETTY HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT AND ITS NOT EXPENISVE TO KEEP USING.\n",
            "I bought this oil to apply on my stomach during my pregnancy. It helps to keep my skin hydrated and the smell is not bad. I generously apply it twice a day to help reduce the dark coloring of my stretch marks (seems to be working... somewhat). I do plan to purchase another bottle as I like how it makes my skin feel. I’ve also began applying it to my face and love how it makes my face glow! It’s not too oily when applied sparingly and keeps my skin from flaking which it’s been doing since being pregnant.\n",
            "Bio-Oil is a must for me. I’ve used this product for 13 years. It helped my scar after neck surgery, my face after some pre-cancer treatments that desperately needed tender care.This oil is smooth and soaks into your skin, it has a light pleasant fragrance.You’ll want to keep this on hand. I’ve even had men  in my family use it after stitches to eliminate scarring.( Amazon has the best price for the most ounces)\n",
            "I bought this because I thought for a second that my stretch marks needed to be removed. I learned that 1. stretch marks are normal and a part of life. 2. there isn't a way to remove them especially with an oil like this. 3. This product is a waste of money. I am better off using lotion or a better body oil. I didn't like the smell of this and it left a weird residue on my skin. Not worth the money and I will not be repurchasing this or recommending this to anyone I know.\n",
            "This item has changed my skin. I’ve been utilizing it for a year and a half and my skin is way better than ever. I blend mine with tea tree oil to treat my skin break out. It’s light, it smells awesome, and it treats existing skin harm. In case you've got sun harm, little wrinkles, discoloration, or skin break out scars you ought to deliver this six months and see in case it works for you.\n",
            "I bought this to use to try to lessen the appearance of stretch marks. I know I’m going to get them and there’s no actual product to prevent them. This is promoted as a product to use during pregnancy for stretch marks but upon further investigation I discovered it contains a form of retinol that my obgyn told me to avoid during pregnancy. So it’s a good product that I haven’t been able to utilize to the fullest yet. Post baby I’m spattering this on. I was also using on scars and scabs and it did help them heal faster.\n",
            "I have dry, sensitive skin, which makes it a vigorous process of elimination for the skincare products just to help me find the right product. I pay close attention to skincare routine suggestions and there was one that stood out:After you take a warm shower, you look into the mirror and your skin looks at its best... but not for long. This is because your skin is highly moisturized from the shower and the humid environment of your bathroom, but this moisture evaporates approximately after 15 seconds of stepping out of the shower. It significantly helps to apply facial oil within this 15 second-time-limit, and this oil helps create a barrier to trap in the moisture. Afterwards, you can relax and take your time to complete the rest of your skincare routine like you usually do.Because I still have some scars on my face, I bought this oil as an addition to my routine. My skin does feel a lot smoother and I have not struggled with dry patches or irritations ever since.\n",

            "I planned to use to help with some old scars.  With my first use, I poured too much oil out (I don’t like the way it dispenses) so decided to just keep massaging in until it was absorbed.  Mulch to my surprise, it extracted a number of large blackheads and dead skin plugs!  I was very surprised because I use an oil cleanser nightly and didn’t expect this but was very happy with the result!  Now I plan to use as a double cleanse option and, over time, maybe it will also help my old scars.\n",
            "Initially excited and appeared good, but sadly disappointed. I thought this would be great to use to moisturize my belly during my first pregnancy. I ordered during the first trimester and waited to use it until the second trimester as it says on the bottle. I enjoyed the smell, textured seemed good for moisturizing but after a couple of uses I noticed my belly getting REALLY itchy every time I used it. At first I thought it was just dry skin but it was only on my belly. Unfortunately the return window has already closed because I followed the directions and didn’t start using until the second trimester. Very disappointed.\n",
            "I was ready to write a really good review about this stuff, I started using it for stretch marks and scars on my arms and legs. I liked the way it smelled it kept my skin moisturized and it seemed to be working. I felt like my stretch marks and scars were starting to fade. But then I started breaking out on my arms and a few spots on my legs, my skin felt irritated and I had to stop using it. I got through about half the bottle then I started breaking out. I have really sensitive skin so I would not recommend this to anyone who has sensitive skin.\n",
            "Used this product from week 16 through week 34 of my pregnancy. Received a sample in my amazon registry box and thought it was actually working so I bought a second bottle during my third trimester. This is my first pregnancy so I didn’t know what to expect, but my belly grew quicker after 30 weeks and I started to see stretch marks. Used more of the product and it was not improving anything and I was still pretty itchy due to the stretching. Switched to Palmers stretch mark relief and within a couple days it began to fade the marks and stopped the itching. This product did not work for me and it smells like a stale tanning salon.\n",
            "I’ve been using this since I became pregnant. It’s really helped during the dry winter weather to help lock in moisture and with the changing body.\n",
            "I got this and had a similar experience as others, I received this oil and it smells strongly like cinnamon. Then my body started breaking out with red dots.....buy it from a store directly!\n",
            "I’ve seen this stuff at Walmart but I’ve never picked up a bottle because it’s so expansive for such a a tiny bottle and I wasn’t sure if it would even work.I’ve been using this stuff for a week and while I don’t have stretch marks from my baby yet!! I do have some old acne scars from high school, along with red, uneven skin, and it seems to help with the appearance of the redness at least. I actually can’t tell if it’s working on the scars yet. Will update if possible!\n",
            "Pros: It’s a great size- a little goes a long way and should last the entire pregnancy.Cons: the smell is kind of funky and it does not help with itching. I put it on when I’m itchy, after showers and before bed.I’m 25 weeks and counting, so I can’t speak to stretch mark prevention.. but I haven’t seen any yet! Overall it’s not my favorite product or first choice. I feel like I need to add an anti-itch moisturizer to my routine.\n",
            "I had some I ordered for some scars.  I decided to use it on my face after hearing people talk about using it on their face with positive results.  I am surprised at how well it worked on my face.  Even wrinkles are starting to slowly disappear.  I use it once or twice a day and it absorbs quickly leaving my skin very very soft.  The scars I had on my nose have started to disappear.  It's amazing stuff.  Much like high end serums that charge $100 and more.  It's amazing stuff.  I started using it on my hands recently and my hands are so soft.  The possibilities are endless with this amazing stuff.\n"

I find not only does this help my dry skin but also with my acne breakouts.  I know!  Putting oil on acne, get out!  But it really works to help moisturize my skin so my body stops trying to self moisturize and clogging up my pores.  Try it, you might love it as much as I do!\n",

It's not a miracle worker. I noticed improvement (fading) in 3-5 days, but it's an ongoing process of continuing to use the product to fade the blemishes. It also has improved the health of my facial skin overall.\n",
            "My doctor kept telling me to just use vitamin E for my surgical scar but I was convinced there must be something better. This really is the only product that has consistently soothed the ache of the scar. You can still see the scar but it just happened in August. Still I have tried many other products over the weeks and keep coming back to this for soothing the ache of the pinched stretched skin\n",
            "The oil is really nice. The smell isn’t too strong, too. It has helped my skin stay hydrated, but I haven’t seen a huge difference with the pregnancy stretch marks. I had in my head that the oil would lighten the marks in about 2 weeks, but I’ve been using it for almost two months every single day, and the marks are still very visible in some sections of my body. I do love using the oil and enjoy the consistency after using it. My body doesn’t feel oily, my skin soaks it in. Overall nice product.\n",
            "I seriously have seen such a difference on my belly! The stretch marks on my belly have lightened so much it’s seriously shocking. All my stretch marks are from pregnancies 7 years ago and then 3 years ago not new ones. Hope this helps!\n",
            "Um, wow. I don’t even know where to begin. I originally got this as part of my skincare routine for my face, but then saw that it could be used on scars as well, so I figured I’d give it a try - couldn’t make things worse, right? I’ve been using this twice a day on the scar on my wrist for 3 weeks, and it has made a HUGE difference. The color is lighter, it’s less raised overall, and it seems to have actually gotten smaller. As a disclaimer, the “before” picture was more than 3 weeks before the “after” picture because I didn’t have a more recent one, but it’s an accurate representation of how my scar looked before starting in with the Bio-Oil. I’m excited to continue using it to see if it helps even more, but if it doesn’t, this is a huge improvement, and I’m so happy with how it’s performed!\n",
            "I absolutely love bio oil...BUT it has Vitamin A in it. I am a little disappointed that it is advertised as safe to use while pregnant. I was lathering this on my belly until my doctor told me to stay away from it. Vitamin A is a retinol and research suggests that all retinoids should be discontinued during pregnancy. Just a heads up for those who did not know this!\n",

I am currently 8 months pregnant so I am also using it in my belly hoping it will prevent stretch marks there. Here crossing fingers that it does. So far no stretch marks in my belly.\n",
            "Advertised as \"non greasy\" which doesn't make sense this is literally an oil that sits right on top of the skin and take forever to absorb. The smell is off putting to me. It has a cheap fragrance smell to it the reminds me of what my grandmother used to use all the time. It smells exactly like \"skin so soft\"  oil from the 90s. Why is this fragrance necessary? I could see it triggering a migraine if you are sensitive.\n",
            "When I got pregnant I had two friends insist that I needed to buy this since they both used it and never got any stretch marks. I've been using it now since the beginning of the second trimester and I'm 33 weeks and don't see a single stretch mark. I use it every morning and evening, and it makes my belly feel really soft and moisturized. It's a bit pricey, but I think it's worth it!\n",
            "I have heard so much about bio oil, and decided to buy this product. I ignored the reviews that said it was counterfeit. I wish I wouldn’t have. This oil burnt my face. It was so red and hurt really bad, I would try and put lotion on it to soothe it and it would make it burn even more so very uncomfortable!Do not use if you have sensitive skin!!!!!\n",
            "Pic is top-feb 19th bottom is May 19th. I’ve used this now for 3 months, everyday after shower or every other day. It’s a little greasy after use so I wash my hands. I started using on my fresh 6 month belly stretch marks after twin pregnancy. I don’t know if I can really tell a huge difference so I will keep using. Always worth a try. Get small bottle it goes a long way, or maybe I’m not using enough. Lol.  UPDATE!! 4 months of use after every shower.\n",
            "Has a nice scent and absorbs rather quickly. It’s great for sensitive skin. Very moisturizing. I’m currently using it for baby belly stretch marks. I’m using it daily. I don’t feel greasy or icky after I put it on. Overall great product.\n",
            "This product is magic! I originally purchased it in 2018 with my first pregnancy to help prevent stretch marks. I didn't think I could say enough good things about it then, as I didn't get a single stretch mark! I purchased it again for pregnancy #2 ,and not only do I use it on my belly but recently have been using it on my face. It may sound crazy, but my typically oily skin is much smoother and even. It even seems to help keep my acne at bay! Truly amazing!\n",
            "Composed of mostly meneral oil, this product does hydrate.I have been using it dor about 2 weeks.I was in a car wreck that caused sever abdominal scaring. I see no change in appearance as they advertise.\n",
            "I absolutely love this! I'm 8 months pregnant with twins so I'm huuuuge. I think stretch marks mostly happen based on genetics and thats probably why I don't have any (yet). HOWEVER, I put this stuff on at night and my skin is so so so soft. I can tell its really absorbing it. My legs also get really bad razer burn after shaving(I'm cursed). Usually the only thing I can put on is coconut oil, but now I can use bio oil and it doesn't sting at all!\n",
            "This has really helped me with some old scars.  I use it once a day before I go to bed.  A little goes a long way!  Within a month or so I was seeing a difference in my scars.  Would definitely recommend!\n"

Of course that could be from a few of the oils found in bio-oil that are very beneficial to us for many reasons, Lavender, Rosemary and Chamomile Oil. I talked my fiancé into trying it and was surprised that he liked the smell and all around results when using bio-oil 1-2 times daily. Will recommend and will buy again !\n",
            "After having my first baby, I noticed my skin became sensitive and very dry. The normal lotion didn't fit my need, so I added 2 drops into the lotion to moisture my whole body skin every day. After using it for 3 days, my skin became better! That's impressive. I'd highly recommend not to use too many drops once, or it would cause acne. However, I didn't like the design of the bottle itself. Why not design it as a push-on bottle? It's very inconvenient. I waste a lot of the oil just because it slips from my oily hand... That's super annoying.\n",
            "This oil was recommended by my doctor after a procedure on my legs caused hyperpigmentation. I used it every day but the dark patches never faded away so I stopped using it after 3 months.\n",
            "This is like my 10,000ty bottle of bio oil. I swear, I used this my entire pregnancy and I didn’t get one stretch mark. I also used it on my face for a while and notice some old acne scars started to fade. It’s a little thick to use on your face all the time though. The formula is long lasting because of how thick the oil feels.\n",
            "Quick turnaround time from order to delivery but when I opened the package the box was damaged. Luckily, the actual product wasn’t leaking or it was definitely getting returned. I love this stuff and definitely in need since I’m further in my third trimester, I am not willing to go through the hassle of returning only to run into the same issue again. Figured might as well keep it. Please do better with the packaging though. Highly disappointing.\n",
            "While it's a healing oil and it moisturizes well, it leaves a tacky feeling after applying. However, works well for its intent if you can get over that feeling.Unfortunately it arrived in an open box, so that made me nervous but I still used it and its a fine product, nothing amazing for me personally.\n",
            "I really enjoyed this product. The scent isn’t awful but it definitely isn’t pleasant. I have very sensitive skin and I’ve had no issues at all. I use this oil after my shower nightly, and wash off what ever is left over the next morning. It is an oil so I do not use it durning the day for the sole purpose that it makes my face super shiny. I can’t say if the product lives up to its intended use, but regardless I love this stuff. I also have only used it on my face so I can’t comment for use in other areas. I wouldn’t say it’s moisturizing but it’s for sure hydrating. I can’t wait to see what it does for my skin in the winter. And I will say my natural skin seems to be so radiant and glowing after using this consistently.\n",
            "Fake product mostly just water or extremely diluted, no oily feeling as compared to the same product I purchased from store. Shame on the seller and manufacturer\n",
            "Currently 6 weeks postpartum. I enjoyed the scent, my husband hated the smell. Used it on off throughout my first (only) pregnancy, delivered my baby, never had any stretch marks. Pretty sure it’s not because of this since I didn’t use it consistently but who knows. As for stretch marks I had on my inner thighs, I was also applying... they didn’t disappear but are very unnoticeable to others.\n",
            "This is my first time ever using this product. I thought it was just for pregnant women but when I got my scars from a gallbladder removal and a blood drain tube I was recommended this product by a coworker. First; the presentation of this product is beautiful, secondly; the smell is so light and soothing, and third and most importantly; this actually works. It's not a miracle overnight remedy but by using it for only a month I can already see a change in my scars and the quality of my skin around the area. I now use this for my hands too, especially as the colder weather is starting to set in, as well as scaring from mosquito bites this summer. I love this product and will be ordering again!\n",

She said I need to buy “him his own bottle!” Her arms should be in a commercial for Biooil. If I took a before/after pic no one would believe it. After just 3 days. This stuff is beyond my expectations. It is something so odd how it’s oil but not oily. It actually does go in your skin and you can actually unscrew a cap with it on your hands because it’s NOT OILY. Crazy but true. It works wonders on dry skin. And I’ve never even tried it on scars. Just the elderly because I’m a nurse.\n",

I saw the bottle was different but mines actually came in like the original one! Packaging & everything was exactly how it was suppose to be! And the smell?? It smelled like the actual one & even had that consistency! I definitely recommend getting it, I’ll let y’all know if it actually works! :)\n",

I have hope that this will perform like they claim!  I am very happy so far!\n",
            "I had used this previously for stretch marks and i worked well.  Someone told me it works well as a facial moisturizer and wont clog pores.  I was hesistant because pretty much all facial products make me break out and sure enough I did get not one single blemish when I started using this.\n",
            "I have a surgery scar on the inside of my wrist/forearm and it was recommended that I try this to help moisturize and decrease the scar. Unfortunately, I have sensitive skin and after putting this on, I got immediate hives, redness and terrible itching. I couldn't power through the insensitivity and ended up having to wash my arm several times to get it off. If you have sensitive skin, try in a VERY small area first.\n",

It hydrates my skin and leaves a smooth finish, but dark spots and stretch marks have rarely faded because of this product. It doesn't matter how much or how less you use, this results are pretty simple. If it was slightly better I'd buy again.\n"

Make sure you buy the right bottle, not the copy cat that's why there is a mix of reviews. This does not smell much and she feels it helping. It is oil so let it absorbed before putting clothes over. Try doing this after a bath and towel dry. Even the bumps are diminishing. Just keep being persistent. It's been a couple of months and they are looking lighter and smoother! I would recommend!\n",

I’m currently 26 weeks pregnant and have no stretch marks (not sure when they start appearing) I started off using the bio oil gel with belli oil. but as soon as I started using the bio oil oil my sides broke out. I have tiny pimple like bumps. They’re not itchy nor they hurt but they look so ugly and it’s been about three weeks and I still have them\n",

            "on performance i'd rate bio-oil a five. unfortunately, to me, the fragrance of the product was so sicking sweet i discontinued use after four applications. the aroma lingers, it doesn't wear down. in the morning it will smell as it did at night. the smell isn't strong like bad perfume or over powering like cigar smoke it's just sickeningly sweet. it's an unidentifiable aroma.however, we experience smell differently so it may not bother you. others have posted they liked the fragrance.i bought bio-oil for moisture and on that count it worked very well. my skin is highly sensitive and i had no problems.\n",
            "My husband’s friend recommended this product to prevent stretch marks. I didn’t have stretchmarks but my pregnant tummy was getting bigger so I purchased this. After one application, my stomach broke out in hives and became unbearably itchy so I started scratching so I ended up with stretch marks which beats the purpose of buying and using this. I threw it away. It was a waste of money for me since it’s so expensive :(.\n",
            "I been using it for a month and it has actually made some results. My skin is softer to the touch, skin tone seems like it equalized overall so i got a better skin color or maybe less marks. My nose used to dry and have dead skin over it and hasnt happen lately. So far so good. Might keep buying. I noticed some decreased scar visibility, gonna take time for sure but its showing some result\n",
            "I started using Bio Oil during the first trimester with my first child. A veteran you tube momma recommended it in one of her videos to prevent and minimize stretch marks. I was terrified of getting that squiggly lined loose skin appearance on my stomach/breasts. The directions say to start two a day applications during second trimester. I started during my first. I'm using Bio Oil again now for my second pregnancy and I'm seven months along with ZERO stretch marks, scars or loose skin ANYWHERE on my body. Yes, I know, this is much attributed to genetics and body type but I am a firm believer that the BIO OIL is the overall culprit for my skins success throughout my two pregnancies. I always recommend this to any newly pregnant mom and if I the Lord blesses me with anymore babies in the future, I will 100% be using my beloved BIO OIL. A must have during AND after pregnancy!\n",
            "After about 2 months and 2 bottles  of consistent use I have seen a noticeable difference I wish I had more before pictures but my stretch marks were always embarrassing and very thick and deep after weight loss . this product definitely lightened them and made the appearance less pronounced. I could imagine if your stretch marks aren’t as deep as mine we’re this could remove them completely.\n",
            "I am using this for EVERYTHING!  I have only used it a few days and already see a dramatic difference in my skin.  i bought this because I just had a mole removed and my daughter has a scar on her face.  We are applying to these areas, but I have used as a moisturizer on my skin (dry), my daughter's skin (combination), both of my sons (both dry, one acne prone) and my husband's skin (oily).  We are all glowing!  and the fine lines in my forehead are noticeably less!!\n",
            "The scent is a light rose. Directions say to apply twice a day, so I apply when I wake up and when I go to sleep. I am using this while pregnant to prevent stretch marks. It says to start in the second trimester, which I have. It is definitely keeping my stomach skin soft. Prior to use, my stomach skin was itchy. I did have one small stretch mark from a previous pregnancy and it is helping that mark be less noticeable.\n",
            "I bought it for lightening my scars, I put it on once a day throughout the whole healing process, but it doesn’t seems to work. As for moisturizing, it’s more like putting oil to cover your pores instead of moisturizing. My skin doesn’t seems to absorb the product as it’s too oily. It didn’t give me any allergic reaction, which is good, but it didn’t get me the result I want either.\n",
            "Nothing but low quality products that sit on top of your skin to trick you into thinking its making your skin softer when It isn’t. The Purcellin oil is trademarked by the company which should be a red flag... the ingredients are mostly chemicals that change the texture and “oiliness” of the product but are not chemicals that benefit the skin in any way. I’ve used It for months and saw zero results... if anything it just clogged my pores because the main ingredient (mineral oil) is paraffin!! My skin is softer after using my usual moisturizer and throwing this product away. Always do your research!\n",
            "This stuff is gold. I think it’s a little pricey for an oil but I’m glad I bought it. It is really great. Even on the face. It eventually dries all the way and really leaves a nice moisturized skin. I love it and will use this for a long long time.\n"

It has really evened out my skin tone and my face is so soft. It has helped with wrinkles a little, but now I use it to dilute stronger creams so I don't burn my skin. I use it on my cuticles as well and my nails look great. It is pricey, but  a little goes a long way.\n",
            "I used this product my entire pregnancy once or twice a day (especially after the shower) and I didn’t get any stretch marks on my belly! (I used the oil then put raw Shea butter on top to be safe) I already had stretch marks on my butt so I put a lot of trust in this product and I was not disappointed. I HATED the smell (smells like a guy fragrance or grandpa) it was strong too. I’m also sad that people said this is a fake because that’s bogus.\n",
            "Made me break out. Not sure about other benefits but after I looked up the ingredients. There are ingredients makes you break out easy. After I stop using it for just a week lot of the acne I got from using this product went away. You can look this up your self. But if you are using it for scars or stretch marks, I don’t know about it.\n",
            "I have been using this for months now, and it helps with the scars. I started using this to help with my acne scars. It does help, but it also takes time. I still have scars but now they are not as noticeable. Seeing as I have dry skin it is a bit moisturizing but not a lot. Thankfully it doesn't stink. The only thing I would change about it would be the applicator. I like to transfer it to a bottle that has dropper as the lid. I would put 2 drops on each cheek and 1 on my forehead.\n",
            "I love this oil, it wipes out any dry patches on my face. I live in Chicago and change my skincare seasonally because my summer moisturizer isn’t heavy enough for the dry winter, I get dry patches on my cheekbones, around my eyes and on my chin. This oil is what will get me through the cold temps and high winds, ya know the kind of weather that makes your face hurt.\n",
            "I am currently 9 months pregnant and have been using this since the first trimester. I wear it only at night because right do t want to be oily during the day. During the day I wear cocoa butter and then I literally bathe in this thunk before bed time. I haven’t gotten a single stretch mark due to the pregnancy. I want to add that I do have stretch marks before I got pregnant so my skin is prone to have stretch marks in the base case which made me extremely worried when I got pregnant. But a friend recommended this and it really made a difference. The smells isn’t great, but who cares!!! No stretch marks is worth it!\n",
            "I used this with my first pregnancy and I’m now using it for my second! It help moisten and I didn’t have any stretch marks. I know most people say that’s up to genetics but both my sisters got stretch marks with their pregnancies so 🤷‍♀️ I also have super sensitive skin, I get a rash from everything and this was amazing for me!\n",
            "I have been using Bio-Oil for over 3 years now, since it was recommended to me by my doctor post-surgery to speed healing and reduce scarring. I absolutely love it! I use it just about every day. I have incredibly sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts, and I can even use it on my face without a problem. I use it every single time I get out of the shower on my face, decolletage, hands and any breakouts I have that are healing. It absorbs quickly and leaves no greasy residue.\n",
            "I found this recommended for treating scars by people who had a breast augmentation. I have been applying this on my neck and face. I have no issues and it is very smooth and non greasy. I cannot tell if the scars are better due to this or the Silagen that was given to me by the plastic surgeon, either way, I am using it and feels like my fine lines are diminishing\n",
            "I've been using Bio-Oil twice a day for about 3 weeks, and it is amazing. I am noticing that a deep scar that I've had on my face since I was 9 (I'm 37 now), from a dog attack is starting to look better already! Also, my forehead lines are looking less prominent. I am AMAZED by this product and will continue using it for years to come.\n",

I also got a smaller sized one just in case it didn’t work out, I’m glad I took the chance on this!\n",

            "As someone who has skin that scars super easily, bio oil is really helpful and there’s a noticeable difference in my scars. HOWEVER, I also have acne prone skin, so when I apply it to my oily T-zone I break out more. Thus I now only use it on my body and cheek areas and I have no complaints :)\n",

The indicator cannot be duplicated!!! This product also came on time and in good condition. If you want bio-oil this vendor is safe to purchase from. Hope this help those of you who are concerned based off the comments, like myself.\n",

I wanted to give it a fair trial time to see if it worked, and unfortunately I missed the return window otherwise would have returned. Very Disappointed, it was not cheap.\n",

            "very moisturizing! i love putting bio oil on after the shower and it has made my stretch marks less red (over the last 6 months) in conjunction weight. i notice that when i don't use bio oil the stretch marks on my hips are puffed up more. oldest scars have started to become less visible. i use this on my face because i have dry skin on my cheeks and it makes my face feel like butter. i can also wait for it to absorb and put lotion on top of it and be fine and not break out. i just wish it would work better on some of my face scars because i will have 3-4 pimples at a given time but they scar bad and most of the blemishes i have are just dark spots.\n",
            "I had a new inscion on my thigh from a hip surgery. I rubbed the Bio-Oil in two to four times a day without noticing any improvement with the appearance of the scar. The Bio-Oil smells good and works as a moisturizer but I purchased it for the scar appearance to be improved. It did not work for me.\n",
            "I do not like the fact that the #1 ingredient is mineral oil. Everyone has always said this is the best product for stretch marks and to moisturize the skin. I use it on my face after I use a scrub to help bring the moisture back into my skin. This is a double edged sword as it does not dry and clogs my pores. The bottle states it is for face and body, so I'm not using it wrong.\n",
            "I don’t have the most sensitive skin at all! But I am having really bad rashes (I thought because of my stretch lines). I figured I needed more moisture.  I use Palmers Whicht calms my skiing irritation but the stretch lines are not going away. So when I read the reviews I figured it will go away without 3 weeks. Every time I apply it, although the scent is good, it causes a bad irritation on my skin so I have to start all over. Did not work on my skin.\n",
            "I originally gave this a low rating and decided to come back and change it after giving this a second chance. I have horribly dry, acne prone skin, and didn't really see any benefit this product could offer when I was first recommended to try it. Now, after giving it a second chance, I can see why people love this stuff. Not only has it moisturized my skin, but it's helping with the appearance of my old acne marks and just makes my skin look healthier in general. There's also the added bonus that it hasn't seemed to cause any additional breakouts for me, which many products do. I will definitely buy this again.\n",
            "Love this so much! I tell all my friend/family to get it!i had a noticeable improvement in stretch marks within the first couple of weeks. I have reordered it once already and will continue to do so. It isn’t greasy. Smells very lightly scented and just makes my skin soft. Highly recommend trying it!\n",
            "I was a huge skeptic... How can an oil reduce thick, dark, and unsightly scars? Well, I'm no longer questioning it because this stuff WORKS! I'm so impressed with it and its only been 3 months of daily use. It's significantly improved my scar, just look at my pic! I'm going to continue using it everyday as I'm sure it'll only keep reducing the redness around my scar. So happy!\n",

            "Ive used this with both of my pregnancies it it worked wonders for my skin. I like to mix mine with my moisturizer and body lotion. I also used this for my scars from having my gallbladder out and they have faded drastically. I know a lot of these reviews said fake but mine was true to color and smell and same consistency so no issue there. If you’re scared to buy off here at least try it from the store, you won’t be disappointed!\n",
            "I love this stuff. A dermatologist recommended it to me years ago to help fade scars, and I just recently started using it again for stretch marks during pregnancy. I use it everyday, twice a day. It’s very moisturizing and lasts a pretty long time. The scent is nice too. I was hesitant to buy it at first because of the reviews that say it’s fake, but I didn’t notice any difference in color, consistency, or scent between this one and the one I bought at the store. It takes a little bit of time to soak in, but after it does my skin feels really soft.\n",
            "Very good for healing scars when used with a fresh wounded area. Also used starting around week 35 to prevent tearing during childbirth and it worked great! The scent is the only thing I would change about it, not a great smell.\n",
            "I was skeptical about this product at first, but I’m so glad I tried it!! I use at night (it has replaced my Clinique products) and noticeable pimples disappear overnight with this product! It’s quite amazing. It’s very oily so I only use it at night (I use a light moisturizer during the day), but my skin absorbs the oil pretty readily. I’ve noticed improvement in blemishes as well as a brighter complexion in general. It’s amazing how well this product works, especially since it is so inexpensive.\n",
            "I look forward to bath time because it means I get to apply this right after. The scent is really divine. It isn’t overwhelming for me.I bought this because I’m pregnant (plus mommies-to-be community recommends this) and—although genetics plays a big role—I wanted to take certain steps to at least minimize stretch marks.  No stretch marks yet but it’s because I’m only 14 weeks, so I cannot vouch for the effectiveness yet.This does feel moisturizing and doesn’t feel greasy.Will recommend and repurchase. 👍🏽\n",
            "First time purchasing this so I can’t comment as to whether this is authentic or a knock-off of Bio oil. However, this oil is wonderful. It smells amazing, have a perfect consistency and makes my skin smooth and not greasy just as advertised. Will absolutely purchase again.\n",
            "I have not just super dry and super sensitive skin but also have Rosacia . My doctor recommended bio oil as I mentioned that my prescription Cremes make my skin feel even more dry and so I was given samples of bio oil to try . So far so good my skin appears to handle this product very well\n",
            "So far so good! I'll be 7 months next week and have been using it for almost two months now and I'm all out. No stretch marks yet (hopefully never) but I'm going to repurchase again!UPDATE: 4months post partumAs soon as I turned 9 month pregnant stretch marks came out of the no where! They were itchy and red and covered my whole entire belly! I was disappointed because I used this product religiously every single day 3 times a day! I’m not 4 months post partum and the stretch marks are still there. I’m still using this product with hopes they go away. But not expecting anything anymore.\n",
            "I was a tad skeptic as I read reviews that said the product was a scam and not the real thing. This is the same bio oil at the drugstores/target..etc It smells really good and feels good on my skin. I've been using it for almost 2 weeks and 2 tiny scars on my forearm have already faded dramatically. I bought it initially for a much larger scar and have been alternating between the bio oil and silicone scar tape. So far so good! Don't hesitate to purchase!\n",
            "So I bought this product to use for my stretch marks and I have been using it for almost 2 months and at first I really thought it was making a difference and I bought the bigger bottle, but i regretted it.  I looked at the before and after photos and saw no difference, I thought that at least I would avoid the appearance of new streaks, but even that didn't do it.  Disappointed\n"

However, the scent is so different from what I used in Ireland, that I could not use it, and  gave it away.This was always a good product, but the smell is too overpowering, something has changed. Dommage.\n",
            "I heard many good things about this product all overall social media about how well it heals scars. I personally have struggled with acne scars on my back and chest, so I thought I'd give this product a shot. It works awesome! I only put it on after I take showers and it has cleared my back and chest up so much! Highly recommend!\n",

I am a male who finally shaved his beard off and it hurt to even touch around my jawline due to build up of skin and undergrowth hair without shaving/exfoliating and now my skin has been rejuvenated, wrinkles decreasing to nearly gone on my forehead, skin color is back, the shape of my face is coming back and I just feel like I will use this product for the rest of my life\n",
            "I had to admit this but I’ve had a few stretch marks show up after a recent weight gain. After hearing about a pregnant friend use Bio oil on her bump, I thought I might as well give it a try! One week later and seriously my stretch marks are almost all the way gone. This stuff is a miracle worker!\n",
            "Had a cut and rash on my ankle and have been using this oil and Vaseline interchangeably so it doesn’t leave a scar. As you can tell by the before and after pictures it worked very well. Very oily though, unless you want stains all over your bed sheets you have to cover it or wrap it so it doesn’t get everywhere\n",
            "I looove this! My favorite moisturizing oil. Doesn’t feel heavy and the scent is very light. A little goes a long ways and is definitely worth it. I use it for my face (at night) and for my body, love that it’s multifunctional.\n",
            "I’ve been using this product to hopefully prevent stretch marks throughout my entire pregnancy pretty much, however I use it in conjunction with Burt’s Bees Belly Butter. After my showers, I apply the oil (let it soak in for a few minutes), then the belly butter and I still have 0 marks at 39 weeks pregnant.My mom and sister have stretch marks from their pregnancies so I expected to get them regardless, but I seem to still be in the clear. I don’t have much longer to be pregnant but I know if I end up having a c-section, I will definitely be applying this to that future scar too.I feel like this helps lighten some darker acne scars on my face too. I don’t use much, just moisturize those specific areas.\n",
            "The smell of this alone irritated my skin. None of what was promised happened, the fragrance made my skin itchy, it takes too long to sink in and never fully does and it didn’t fade my scars. I could only stand to use it a few times, I can’t believe something this strongly scented is marketed to people with sensitive skin.\n",
            "I have tried almost every product and home remedy to try to get rid of stretch marks or atleast fade them. I was successful with a it works cream but it only faded them. I have used for about a month and my dark purple stretch marks have turned white and my white ones seem to blend with my skin more. I am so happy with my results. I have refused to wear shorts/dresses for the ones on my legs and I'm getting excited for summer. I'm excited to continue using this products and see what further results it will bring. You do need to use this product EVERY morning and night. The price isn't bad for the size a small bottle lasted me about a month. I'll definitely be ordering a bigger bottle.\n",
            "This product is good.  It was recommended to me by my vascular doctor.  She said it was good.That was an understatement.  My skin on my leg is very dry and rough.  I have used prescription salves and non prescription products.  This beats them all.  Just takes a few drops to cover a good sized area twice a day.  If you have some really tough skin problems,, this product is certainly worth a try.\n",

I still have a ton left because a little goes a long way.It doesn't make you break out, and if anything it helps keep my skin clear.  It's difficult finding a moisturizer that ☑️ all the boxes but this is it!\n",

My skin was covered in a horrible rash and I have use the real bio oil before in my last pregnancy, so I know I’m not usually allergic. Do not buy this you will have scars all over your pregnant belly like me.\n",
            "Love this stuff. A friend recommended this product and she has amazing skin, so I tried it. I was a little nervous because I have oily skin, but I love it! I use it after washing my face in the evening. In the morning a just rinse my face with water and don’t need to re-moisturize. I have tried numerous facial lotions over the years and just hadn’t found anything I really liked. I also didn’t want to break the bank. This one works great and is super affordable.\n",
            "I bought this 3 weeks ago and I use it twice a day. I have already seen a big difference in the appearance of my skin. It really does work for even skin tone and scars. Will definitely buy again and recommend!\n",
            "I have sensitive skin and tried a cocoa butter oil on my pregnant belly and immediately broke out in a rash.. this Bio-Oil was a life saver and didn’t do that! I used it after every shower the last 3 months of pregnancy and only have 2 stretch marks! And my c-section scar is almost gone too now after only a few weeks of applying this to it! A must have for all mamas!\n",
            "I used this for the entire duration of my 2nd & 3rd Pregnancy, and I did not get the 1st stretch mark! It also reduces the appearance of old and new scars, with daily use! I use daily after I get out of the shower. I also use on my face as a massage oil for a rolling stone or facial massager. It has dramatically faded my old scars on my body, and acne scars on my face from when I was younger. I absolutley Bio oil. I recommend to everybody!\n",

            "I absolutely love this product. I’m currently 7 months pregnant and I apply this oil to my stomach. So far I have no stretch marks. This oil smells good as well. I definitely recommend and I will be repurchasing.\n",
            "I’ve been using this for a year now on my face and it feels great. It really has help even my skin tone on my face. It doesn’t clog my pores and I kind use it as a night time moisturizer.Update:I don’t use this anymore but not because it was bad but there are other natural oils that are better like rosehip, a than, or jojoba. This was a great starter, but there are better and cheaper alternatives.\n"

I have super sensitive skin and this didn't seem to irritate it for the two days I used it (once per day). But I honestly just couldn't stand the scent and decided to return it. It didn't give me a headache, I just found it unpleasant and pervasive.\n",
            "love this product. Used it from my 2nd trimester on, usually once in the morning and once in the evening. I didn't get a single stretch mark on my stomach or sides. I started using it because I had already started getting stretchmarks on my boobs ( booo ). my boob stretchmarks decreased in redness and i don't think i got many more (if any) since i started using it. Unfortunately I stopped using it once i gave birth. Well, when my milk came in i got more stretch marks on my boobs...In short, definitely decreased redness of my stretch marks. Probably stopped more from accumulating (but can't be 100% percent sure).\n",
            "I’ve only used 2 times and I hate the smell. So gross. Using it for pregnancy so can’t speak to how effective. It’s also a thicker sticky consistency. I wonder if this is actually the true bio oil people rave about. I recommend the Hatch oil 100x over this. More expensive but it has a pleasant smell and worked up through 8 mos\n",
            "Exactly what I needed! This helps with my scarring SO much.. I’ve been using it whenever I’ve needed to fade a new scar or old one, and now mine are almost not visible. I ordered this because no stores in my area stocked it, and to my surprise it was cheaper and arrived very quickly! Will definitely re-order when I’m out again.\n",
            "Box came damaged in the weirdest way, even thought the amazon envelope was undamaged which means it was likely shipped that way and not an issue with the carrier. The box had no safety seals, and the product itself did not have any either. I will still use it because it is for an old, healed scar on my leg but I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone with fresh scars or facial scarring. I recommend buying from a drugstore to make sure you’re getting the real thing\n",

            "So back in July I got breast augmentation surgery. Because of this I have dark purple and red scars under my breast and dark stretch marks forming on my breast. I’ve only been using this product for about 2 weeks. The first week I was only putting it on before bed but the second week I added it to my morning routine as well and WOW. This stuff works wonders! My stretch marks aren’t completely gone but the overall redness and purple ness is almost completely gone. As well as that silvery look you get from stretch marks as well! My scars are still very dark but not as raised as they were 2 weeks ago! Definitely recommend for smaller stretch marks! I’ll update my post with the results of my scarring as well.\n",
            "I heard very good things about this oil so I decided to give it a shot. I was sadly disappointed. I started using it when I was about 6 months pregnant. I am currently 5 months post partum. I didn't notice any real difference in my skin and it certainly hasn't help to prevent or lighten my stretch marks. The only good things I can say about it is that it obsorbs into the skin very well and isn't greasy.\n",

            "I really love this product. My self harm scars have started to fade and are less noticeable thanks to bio oil. I didn’t really think it’d work but it did. I know there’s someone out there struggling with the appearance of their scars and just know this works, you should try it out :) also apply once or twice a day. You’ll see results in a couple of months.\n",
            "My pregnant friend recommended this oil and I absolutely love it. I love the scent and how it feels on your skin. It doesn't stain my clothes. I don't really know if it's helping with stretch marks, but it does help with keeping my pregnant belly moisturized. I notice if I don't use it that my belly gets itchy and dry.\n",
            "Used my whole pregnancy and NO stretch marks!\n",
            "My girlfriend took a tumble and it tore up her knee. She's a fan of shorts and felt a bit self conscious with the scar that formed. I took a flier on this cream because it was so highly rated and it was good. A dark brown scar became less noticeable after about 2 months of applying it twice a day.\n",
            "Okay while this Bio Oil did keep my skin moisturized during my pregnancy it did not stop or prevent stretch marks at all. I applied it every day at least three times a day and started very early in my pregnancy. While i wasn't positively confident that it would prevent or improve scars or stretch marks I had some hope. If you want to pay for overpriced body oil that simply keeps your sin moisturized go for it but I would recommend just saving our money and buying coconut oil or something cheaper that does the same thing. Also the smell isn't great, while it doesn't smell terrible it doesn't smell good and it has a slightly off smell.\n",
            "I have used this product two months already, it just like the ordinary face oil, it didn’t turned out as the product description said, so I went back to check the review that rated one star , from there, a lot of people mentioned it was fake.\n",
            "I love this stuff... it has a light pleasant scent, it absorbs quickly so you don’t feel greasy and a little goes a long way. While I don’t use it on my whole face, it made my chin congested and I got a small pimple, I use it literally everywhere except my chin- everywhere. I’m 46 but my skin is softer than its ever been... stop reading and buy some, hurry up!!!\n",
            "I have only been using this product for about two weeks now and I can already see a difference in my skin. I have sensitive mostly dry skin and this has worked wonders. So far no irritation and my complexion is evening out. I have been using it mainly on areas of my face where there are dark marks. I use it after washing and toning, and before moisturizer and SPF. I would recommend for anyone looking to correct discoloration and/or dark spots.\n",
            "I heard a lot of good things about the product for acne scars. I used it one night and woke up with hives all over my face. I used to have sensitive skin when I was younger and would get hives often but I haven’t in years. But this product, from using it for one time, has given me residual painful hives all over my face for like two weeks now and I have done EVERYTHING to get rid of my hives and irritation. I have avoided using other products on my face, I use Aquaphor to reduce the dryness, I've replaced my pillow cases and washed my masks numerous times and I still can't get rid of the hives and irritation.  If you have even slightly sensitive skin I would say do not get this.\n"

We wound up having to douse her in corn starch to easy her itching and the next day we had to go to the ER. Needless to say, I recommend that you stay far away from this product.\n",
            "I was a little skeptical when I first purchased this oil but it honestly works so well. I’ve been using 1 drop of it every day on a scar that I’ve had for about 2 years now. The scar is still visible but it is not as noticeable and it is much softer. I would totally recommend this product. This product also lasts a LONG time. Totally worth every penny!\n",
            "I love the scent of this oil and I love that it does moisturize your skin but not anything heavy. I don't see any improvements in my scars, like fading away old scars or stretch marks.  Also I read instructions that you should use it twice a day and I don't. Ambi fade cream works better. I just hate the smell. But I may purchase bioOil again, just because I like that it moisturizes my skin and leaves a shine, along with the fact that it smells good.\n",
            "I absolutely love this product. I ordered it after I saw a commercial advertising it. I have really bad stretch marks from my first pregnancy 12 years ago and nothing has really helped. This product has made such a difference for me and my self confidence. Of course it did not make them go away, but it did lighten them to a faint pink color and with a little sun on my skin they blend it and are hardly visible. I now also use it on my face and body to even out skin tone and recently applied it to a sunburn and it worked wonders. This is my favorite product I am using right now and I order it every month!\n",
            "It does not have a scent, and absorbs quickly!\n",
            "I bought this because of the reviews, I'm using it on my scars, and so far I don't notice any difference but it is way too soon to tell.  It does absorb well and my skin is softer where I use it so it's worth it.  I've used it on my very dry face, and found it really feels good and works! A tiny bit is all you need.\n",
            "It’s an ok oil so far only been using a few days now. I got the oil to help with scars on my body because I read that’s what it was good for. My first impression of the oil was the smell wasn’t that appealing to my taste. My skin didn’t absorb it fast which left me feeling moisturized longe. I did not have have any bad reactions to it so so far so good.\n",
            "Great quality. I would order again.\n",
            "I found that sunburns heal almost overnight with this oil! It's very good for moisturizing skin. The scent can be a bit heavy if you are planning to wear perfume. It's pricey, but lasts a long time. Not greasy in feel but since it's an oil, you do need to let it soak in before you can move about without transfer.\n",
            "If you read some of the other reviews about them being sent a fake product, I don't believe they are doing that anymore. I received an authentic bio oil and it seems that most people who ordered in 2020 have gotten the same. Used it last night, so good so far.\n",

The only thing I hate is the application. It's almost impossible to apply this to any part of my body without getting oil on the bottle, and then wherever I set the bottle there's an oil ring when I pick it up next time. It's a bit of a mess!\n",

Only good thing is this does not cause any allergy or make the scar worse.  I am not happy with it since I spend so much time try to chase my son to put it on everyday!  Very Disappointed!!!  Really wish it worked...\n",
            "After 6 days of use I developed a red, hot, itchy rash on my belly, hips, and breasts. I should have known better with something that smells SO chemically, but I was tricked into a false sense of safety by $&@#ing instagram influencers. Lesson learned. This is like spreading toxic oil spill directly on your skin. I do not normally have sensitive skin and have never reacted like this to a skincare product.\n",
            "Great for stretch marks, blemishes, and damaged skin. Doesn't feel too oily either and smells pleasant.  Softens my skin as well.\n",
            "I had breast implants a few months ago, been using this per many recommendations to minimize stretch marks. I’ve used it prior to getting implants too and it makes your skin look hot & moisturized. You know those ladies who have like perfect looking moisturized and not to shiny legs this does that! Worth it. You’ll be feeling fly and hot as hell!\n",
            "AMAZING!!! Scars, stretch marks (even purple deep ones), and blemishes have disappeared!!Smells like cinnamon.Ignore the fake product reviews that must be for another one with a cheaper price.This stuff works miracles!\n",
            "I was a little nervous to buy this product since multiple people had reported it as a fake. That was not my experience. What I received matches the picture and a previous bottle I have. Scent is the same too. I love this oil - it’s very moisturizing and easy to apply (bottle doesn’t let it spill all over). I’m just over 4 months pregnant, so have a bump but not a lot of stretch yet. I can’t comment on its effectiveness in that department, but at least I feel like I’m going to prevent those stretch marks!\n",
            "Good\n",
            "Great oil mixture for scars or eczema it seems as winter approaches. Excited to see if this helps with my scars but so far extremely moisturing and the smell is very light \"old lady\" floral perfume scented but it's not very noticable and almost all oils will have a scent. The scent doesn't bother me enough to not give this a shot like others complain about in the comments.\n",

It absorbs into the skin so well I JSU be careful not to put too much a little works well and after it absorbs I put a little lotion but it’s not really needed.

            "I was skeptical to order this off of amazon bc  I saw many reviews that received fake products but I ordered anyway and I got the original! It works so well on my stretch marks and dark spots anywhere on my body. My stretch marks have been fading and I started using it for my dark circles too! Smells good too but it’s a little powerful for me if I use too much. It’s so moisturizing  I use it before I go to bed and wake up Very moisturized.\n",
            "I have combination skin and it's been so hard to manage. Every moisturizer I would use wouldn't moisturize my dry patches and would leave the oily parts of my skin even worse than it started. This stuff changed my life. My face is consistently hydrated and it takes away all of the oiliness. It smells wonderful and leaves your skin very soft. I've also noticed significant difference in my scars. I've only been using it for a week and it has already worked wonders. If you have combination skin, this is a great product to add to your skin care routine. I can't speak for other skin types, though.\n",
            "Got this for my breast augmentation surgery since I was scared of getting stretch marks & I heard that the stretched out skin gets itchy after surgery.... and this has soothed my skin SO MUCH. It has a funny smell like the Mederma stretch mark oil but that doesn’t bother me. It is really good at calming down irritated skin!\n",
            "I ordered this product because I had a severe burn on my hand and it took almost two months to heal however there was no scarring which is exactly what the product claims to do.  It works and is very reasonably priced.\n",

I read a few reviews stating that the product was not the same but trusted my past experience.  Unfortunately, it has changed.  in the past, BioOil always left my skin bright and full of moisture.Im not sure what has changed but when i use it my skin looks dry and ashy and feels dry to the touch.  I am sad to say i need to find a different oil and I'm returning this one.  SO SO Disappointed\n"

On my hips, it seems like it has just lightened my stretch marks, but on my face, applying this before bed seems to have really helped me with my acne scars. It has also helped my sensitive skin with redness and uneven skin tone without clogging my pores or making me break out. If you combine this with a chemical exfoliant and a vitamin c serum, consider your acne scars gone in a few weeks!\n",

I use this mostly in the winter on my inner thighs, ankles and shoulders where I seem to get dry skin the most. I've put this on my hands at night time to help with cracked knuckles and I was pleased with the results. This is a good body oil to have on hand. The scent is \"clean\" to me... I don't mind it.\n",

I was late to use this after pregnancy, but I'm confident in this product. Smells great, feels pampering. Im glad its on amazon.This same product is $28-29 at stores like CVS and Walgreens. Glad i found it here.\n",
            "This definitely makes my skin softer and takes away some of the rough areas. I didn't give a 5 star (yet at least) since I'm still figuring out how well it works on scars. I had a recently new scar on my hand I was testing it on and since I can still see it after a couple months, it's still kind of debatable. Will say I don't use it the two times a day, but I've been using it for the past couple of months once a day. I can definitely tell when I forget to put it on as my rough spots are a little rougher the next day. So it will definitely help your hands and skin feel softer.\n",
            "I love this product. I'm a first time mom and I've used it my whole pregnancy. It's kept my skin soft and I've not had ANY stretch marks. Pre-pregnancy I was 125 lbs and I've gained about 30 lbs and I'm in my 7th month. I would highly recommend this product to a friend and I actually bought this for my friend who is 2 weeks behind me in her pregnancy. It's kept me from itching when my skin is stretching. I'm going to keep using it post-partum as well. I put it on my belly, breasts, back, and bottom after I dry off from the shower.

I also did not enjoy the smell - its weird and strong\n",

One other product I suggest pairing this with Vital Proteins Collagen Peptides, an oral supplement of collagen which helps with skin elasticity. Note that not all collagen supplements are pregnancy safe (i.e. Marine collagen is not) Here's what I take: https://amzn.to/2tyiX5v\n",
            "I had spots on both legs where I'd run into corners of furniture or something and there was a red mark that never went away. I guess they were scars. I don't even know. They weren't scabs. Anywho, I slathered some oil on both legs last night after a bubble bath and then toweled them off a bit because it was a little sticky, and went to bed. This morning, those spots that have been there for maybe a year are almost gone! Your results may not be the same, but, I can hardly believe the difference. I'm putting some more on right now. It's miraculous. I usually can't stand feeling sticky, but, firstly, it's not that sticky, and secondly, totally worth it for these results.\n",
            "I started using this product immediately after giving birth and holy cow I can’t believe the improvements. It doesn’t work overnight, it takes time, but I am 9 weeks postpartum and these are my results. I will continue to use this everyday!It has a good scent and is super easy to use.\n",

            "Smells like the regular chapstick which I love.  Very moisturizing. Not sure if it made a difference in my skin but I like it as basic winter go to for hands, elbows, neck and chest.  I have very sensitive skin and stopped putting on my face r/t greasy feel & no improvement in facial skin.\n",
            "I know a lot of people love this oil, but I find it to thick for my skin, it doesn't absorb as well as other oils I've used. It feels like it's just sitting on my face with this lingering fragrance. I also find it a bit greasy, you will need to clean your phone screen and wash your hands if you touch your face a lot.\n",
            "Used this right after pregnancy, only a few times a week, and it actually improved the look of the strech marks WAY more than I thought it would. Everyones different, but I would highly recommend giving this a try as im sure it would work some serious miracles when used as directed! Alsooo, it absorbs very well into your skin so you dont have to worry abouy it getting onto your clothing and staining it!\n",
            "I love this stuff! I first bought this 5-6 years ago in South Africa, where Bio-Oil is made. I am so glad it is now sold everywhere. It smells amazing, but not too strong (I am extremely sensitive to smell). I use it in small amounts all over my body, for scars, stretch marks, dry skin, and uneven skin tone.\n",
            "I have been using Bio-Oil for about two weeks now. Not long enough to notice any big improvements but my complexion does look smoother. I apply after my toner. A small amount goes a long way. 2-3 drops covers my face and neck. Very light oil with a light scent. Absorbs well and leaves skin a little glowy. I sometimes use an additional light moisturizer on top (clinique moisture surge). My skin is sensitive, hyperpigment, acne-prone. I have not experienced any negative reactions to the use of this product. I would recommend.\n"

I had read many suggestions to use it for easing stretch marks during pregnancy... those suggestions were wrong.  It did nothing for the itching and stretching irritation, even with numerous applications.  Wish I wouldn't have wasted my money on it.\n",
            "Wanted to love this but I don’t like how this oil doesn’t dry down for a long time. I know with an oil that is to be expected but if you are using this for pregnancy stretch marks that means not putting on clothes for a while unless you are okay with it getting on everything. That being said, I do still use this from time to time because I really like the smell and how it feels to apply.\n",
            "I love the was it keeps my belly moisturized along the day, I put the oil at 6:30am and get back home at 5:00pm and the belly is still moistured. The scent is great since it is not a very strong one. I’m very white and mu skin is very sensitive to anything very scented and this is the only oil that has covered all my specs. This is the second one I have ordered and will keep on reordering.\n",
            "So far so good. I've been using to attempt to reduce stretch marks during pregnancy and this far it seems well enough. It does however clump together if used with anything else such as lotion so don't try to double up on moisturizer lol. The scent reminds me of a bar of dial soap.\n",
            "I really really wanted to love it. I have very fair, sensitive and dry skin, as well as stretch marks and awful body acne scars. I had some itching with the first use but I kept using it a day and a half longer until unfortunately the itching got really intense and I ended up developing a very itchy, badly  irritated red rash everywhere I had used it. I’m not sure what, but obviously I my body does not like an ingredient or something that is in this. I think it would have been a great product  if I could have used it though.\n",
            "I love the smell of this oil. A little goes a long way. I use it as soon as I get out of the shower. I found this at the end of my last pregnancy and it definitely help reduce the look of my stretch marks after I started using it. I am using it with my current pregnancy and I have four weeks left until I deliver and I have not had any new stretch marks. This product is wonderful and I would highly recommend it.\n",
            "I was excited to receive this item to begin including it in my skincare regimen. Package arrive in a standard Amazon cardboard box with other liquid beauty supplies. All other supplies were secure with vacuumed sealed safety wrap, except Bio-Oil which arrived with no seal and box open. Although the product did not spill or otherwise appeared to be defective, I am unwilling to use. I will probably attempt to buy somewhere else.\n",
            "I think its original, I bough same one in New Zealand from a store and this one works, smells, looks and acts exactly the same. I use it mostly for my face as a moisturizer during nights or after I sunburn, as I cant stand cold greasy creams on my face. Never had skin rashes, pimples or other problem apearing after using this oil as some other products causes on my very sensitive skin. My face freckles kind of dissapeared as well. Now using it even for my fresh surgery scars. Lets see in a few weeks. Scent is soft and pleasent, like that smell honestly. Definitelly recommend.\n",
            "I have sensitive skin, doesn’t have a strong smell but definitely worked great. I did have one issue with using it for stretch marks so if you have stretch marks in a closed area like your stomach or butt, wear loose fit clothing because it can cause boils or cysts because it cannot breath.\n",

So I took a chance and wow I am impressed. I have extremely sensitive skin and skin conditions. So the fact that I have not had an issue in reacting is a plus, also I have seen great improvements in stretch mark pigmentation and their size as well. A little goes a long way since it’s oil based and I only use mine once or every other day. I will purchase again in the future.\n",
            "I wanted to try out this product because it had so many great reviews on balancing any discoloration on the face and helping fade acne scars. This product is something that will be in my face washing AM & PM routine for good now. Not only has it done both of the things that I bought it for, but it also helped my oily face be less oily as well as it's helped lower my adult acne (both in size and in frequency). It sounds like putting on an oil shouldn't do that- but that's exactly what it did for me. The price is great and didn't give me a skin reaction (even though I have sensitive skin). The only reason why I wouldn't give this a 5/5 is due to the smell of this. I really hate the smell- but it works so well that I will be looking past that each time I apply it.\n",
            "It is an oil of the best. I really recommend it 100%. I usually tell the truth when Amazon usually sells things that do not work, but this oil is not really the best in this if you would not spend your money to spend or throw it away;  I recommend it to you a thousand times. I love this product and it smells good and feels good on my skin?\n",
            "I have a sensitive skin and it suits me well. Skin becomes so soft after regular use of it, twice a day. I see it reduces the darkness of spots on skin. I have been using it for a little over 2 months and very happy with the product. I would recommend it to any one struggling with any spot on skin. I don't see them going away yet but improvement is significant. It cleanses the skin.\n",

Combined with DHC cleansing oil and pore milk, this is a good regimen for a person with psoriasis and eczema on their face. Regular creams just don’t do anything and smell so strong.

I was searching for a product that would hydrate the skin before the next session.  I thought I would try this product.It feels like a thinner baby oil and does soak into the skin well.  The only problem I have with the product is the smell (I can't even use the word fragrance).  It smells like roses and I don't care for that artificial odour.  I love roses but the manufactured smell doesn't compare IMHO.I continue to use the product but put another cream over top to mask the odour.  Now I'm calling it an odour (it's graduated from smell)So I'm not sure if the product or the combination of products is working.But hey, it's less than $20 with eligible free shipping when combined with other products and the bottle will last a long time.  Perhaps you won't mind the smell.\n",

            "The first time I bought it, it was for some stretch marks, and I don't even remember if it worked for that. The only thing I remember was that it moisturized my neck and decollete so well that it gave them a pretty sheen like I came from the beach!\n",

            "You have to be consistent with this product everyday to see results. Of course genetics will be the number one factor in stretch marks but applying this product liberally has been so helpful.I used this before I was pregnant and everyday during my pregnancy and any purple marks I had would disappear as long as I kept applying the oil.\n",
            "This oil is supposed to minimize scars and I’ve been using it  for about three months now. I had banged my shin badly on a marble shelf and was hoping it would help the healing process. Once I investigated the ingredients and realize that the main component is mineral oil, which is engineered to keep from penetrating the skin, it made sense to me that I was not detecting any changes in my scars. Even though mineral or oil is toxic, I will continue to try to use it on the small space to prove myself wrong and hope that it will take away this ugly blemish on my shin. If I remember I’ll come back and update my review but for now, no change.\n",
            "This is one of the few things that will bring relief from itching when my husband's eczema gets really bad.  He just puts a little in his bath for allover relief.  I've use it as a burn treatment.  This stuff just seems to be good on your skin period.\n",
            "I'm still early on in my pregnancy (less than halfway there) but it seems to be working in the sense that it moisturizes my skin. I don't see a vast improvement in the appearance of existing scars and it doesn't seem to help much with the itching. It also smells just like Dial soap and the fragrance is off putting to a pregnant woman (in my experience). This was recommended to me by another mom friend and I will continue to use it until I run out, but I don't think I will be repurchasing this.\n",
            "I love the sent. Subtle, fresh, clean. Not sure if it did anything for my stretch marks(they're old and apparently this works best on new scars) but I enjoyed using this as a daily moisturizer. Did not last long though and it was sold out when I went to repurchase 😑. I wish you could get a bigger bottle because it is easy to use thos fast especially if you'll be usinv morning and night.\n",
            "I can’t even tell you how many times I’ve ordered this 😭 MY HOLY GRAIL!!!! It REALLY helps with stretch marks. It’s so moisturizing that it makes my skin smile. My stretch marks faded as soon as I started using this. After my first baby, my stretch marks were very noticeable but I swear that when I started using this it made them almost disappear. Well they’re still there of course it’s not some magic eraser but it definitely helped them look less noticeable by taking away the purple and pink in them. I’m pregnant with my second baby and I have used this since even before I found out cause I will continue to use this every day on my skin. My belly is super moisturized and I haven’t had a single stretch mark. I’m 7 months pregnant and this is working great so far! HIGHLY recommend.\n",
            "So I wasn’t sure about how this would work on stretch marks but it has done a lot. I don’t use it consistently but at least weekly and since February my stretch marks have faded a lot more than I realized until I looked back at the picture. So happy.\n",
            "I originally bought this to try and fade some acne scars. But I keep using it because it is actually preventing the acne in the first place!\n",
            "I really wanted to believe this would work on my scar.  It’s left from Mohs surgery on my nose. Haven’t had this product but a couple of days so I can’t determine whether it actually works. What I do know, is that it has a very strong fragrance that unfortunately I’m allergic to. So, I guess I will never know if it would work. If you don’t have sensitivities to fragrance and it has worked for you, I would really like to know. Will keep trying to find something else without the unpleasant fragrance.\n"

            "When I received this in the mail it seemed to be fine from the outside amazon package but once I cut the package open it was another story. The Bio oil box seal was ripped open and when I pulled the bottle out there was no seal. Listen, this stuff costs nearly the same at Walmart and I am NOT going to put this on any skin.How do I know what's in it? How do I know it's safe? RETURNING asap. Save your time, save your money\n",

            "Love this oil and it came perfectly\n",
            "I had used this product intermittently for a long time and mostly just enjoyed how my skin felt after using it (very moisturized). When I started using it at its recommended rate (twice everyday), I noticed a HUGE difference in existing scars on my knees that were previously \"bumpy\" and somewhat painful. They are basically the same height as the rest of my skin and it's great! Additionally, I've been using it every day for pregnancy and am about 30 weeks with no stretch marks!\n",
            "This product from Amazon does not seem to to genuine.Bought genuine one  from Walmart. The original one smells better and differs slightly in color.\n",
            "Love, love, love Bio-Oil!! Used it religiously through my first pregnancy and never got a stretch mark until 36 weeks when I thought I was young with great skin and didn't need it. I stopped using it and the stretch marks came within in weeks. After my birth I began using it regularly and significantly reduced the stretch marks that could have been prevented if I just finished my pregnancy with Bio-Oil!\n",
            "My body seems to soak this product up which is a good thing because the oil does get all over my clothes. I’m not a huge fan of the scent, it’s not terrible it’s just not my favorite. I started using this towards the end of my pregnancy and I definitely felt like my skin felt moisturized. It didn’t prevent stretch marks all together but who knows how many more I could have had without using this I still use it to see if it will fade them at all.  Not seeing much of different 2.5 months post partly but I enjoy the moisture so I will continue to use.\n",
            "I  use this on my arms and legs and it soaks in very well, it leaves my skin with a dewy, glowy look.  My brother uses this and nothing else on his face for his skin which is fair and dry.  I've tried using it on my dry, acne prone skin and I don't really like it as a cleanser myself, but do use it as an eye makeup remover.\n",

I have scars in my t-zone from picking at pimples from when I was in high school and they’re definitely not as noticeable. Two. Days. TWO, so i can’t wait to see how my skin turns out after continued use! 10/10 recommend\n",
            "It’s recommended to start on your 2nd trimester but I recommend you to start it even earlier. I started to use it at the begging of my 3rd trimester when I already had the stretch marks. It was late but not too late.  I saw one new mark showed up when I started to use it. After one month, that one new mark was gone and no more new marks! My tummy skin became so much smoother. I haven’t seen a great progress of the old marks I already had tho, but it felt much better using it. Will keep using it day and night, and hopefully it will help with my old marks.\n",
            "I bought for an upcoming surgery based on YouTube vloggers that showed their scars after surgery. I used some on my hand to get an idea of what it’s like.  It’s lightly scented, and doesn’t leave your skin greasy. It was easy to rub in and didn’t leave a stain or otherwise effect my clothing.  It’s thick but soft and satiny. Oh, I literally had to put the back of my hand to my nose to smell it, so if you are concerned with scent, don’t be!\n",
            "I was bit by a brown recluse and my arm turned purple and had a ring around it. I was desperate to find something to help the area stay moist so it would not dry out and hurt and also to help not have a huge scar or hole in my arm from the bite.  I found Bio-Oil and it helped with the pain and scarring. You can't even tell where the bite is now. Amazing stuff!!\n",
            "I use this oil at nighttime- moisturizes and I do not feel itchy one bit. Ha also helped with scarring that I have on my abdomen and help prevent/treat stretch marks. The scent is pleasant don’t mind it all. Does not stain my clothes either-will continue to purchase.\n",
            "I purchased this skincare oil because I have some scarring and dark spots on my neck that I would like to fade. However, after a good amount of use, I did not see that many results from it. I will keep on trying it out and will see if time will allow for me to see greater results.\n",

I've also used it on my skin to make it more evenly and on my scars in hopes of fading but have yet to see results. 4 stars because I still have hope and although it's oily, it isn't messy.\n",
            "I LOVE this oil I’ve used it before on some bad scars I had and it works so well with consistent use. Depending on the humidity and how dry your skin is it can sometimes take a little bit to dry, but I’ve put clothes on over before it was completely dry and it didn’t get my clothes all oily and gross and still moisturized my skin to perfection. It also has a mild, clean smell that I really enjoy.\n",
            "I bought the 2 oz bottle for my first time purchase.  I love how light the oil is and how quickly it absorbs into the skin.  The quick absorption is important for me because I don't have much time to wait around before getting dressed.  It smells nice, though I think the smell is slightly masculine.  I can't pinpoint the exact scent, but it is slightly almond-like.  I've been using it twice a day beginning of my 2nd trimester as instructed.  I've gone through almost 1/4 of the bottle in a couple of weeks.  I plan on making another purchase for the remainder of my pregnancy, I'll get a larger size next time.\n",
            "The best! I wish I had started using this sooner- I always thought it was just for pregnancy. I use it all over my body, including face. Love the scent and is extra moisturing without feeling greasy. It always feels like a treat to put this on after a shower!\n",
            "It left my skin feeling like there was a thick layer of oil on it no matter how little I put on. Yes, I know it’s an oil but it was greasy like cooking oil. Didn’t like the scent much and it came to irritate my skin if I used it on my face at all.\n",
            "My mom and I have been using this product for about a month. Stretch marks are fading and the ones on my arms are all but gone. Miracle I love it I put it on my butt, arms, stomach, breast...anywear I particularly want scar free.It is now apart of my daily routine! Can’t say enough good about this place me and my mom love it!\n",
            "I've recently undergone back surgery, and the scar is horrific. I tried using other popular creams, but I would start itching within a few days. Bio-oil is awesome! No allergic reaction, no itching, and has lightened my scar and makes my skin feel soft and healthy! I will be a repeat customer! I highly recommend this product!\n",
            "I love this stuff! I feel so smooth in the morning after I use it. I was worried that I would feel too oily or it would get on my sheets and clothes, but that doesn't happen at all with this stuff. In the morning there's no oily residue and it hasn't stained anything. My dad told me it smells a bit like vicks vapo rub, so if you hate that smell, don't get this, but I don't mind the smell.\n",
            "My daughter has horrible eczema and this oil calms the \"fire\" as she calls it. It glides right on and soothes her skin.I've also put it on my recent sun burn and it took the sting right out.I absolutely recommend this oil!!\n",
            "I ordered two 2oz bottles of BioOil and this is how they arrived. I’m not sure if this is a packaging issue (like the boxes flex and commonly fall apart), or if someone opened these previously. It definitely doesn’t make me feel confident in the product or the strength/components of it. Anyone else have this issue??\n"

I tried so many different home remedies to get rid of my scars bc I was really insecure about it until my friend recommended me this. It’s a plus that it literally leaves my skin glowing in the morning.Update: I’ve been using this for 2 years now and I use it every single morning and night on my face. It also really helps with stretch marks so I’ll use them on my thighs before bed but you have to apply it everyday to see a difference in your. I also have some bad scarring on my leg from a bike accident and it definitely made a huge difference!\n",
            "I ignored the bad reviews, hoping the product was legitimate. NOPE! The box arrived ripped on the side and with the seal already broken. Smelled differently than my regular bio oil as well. Shame on Amazon for allowing bad product to continue to be sold! Stay away!\n",
            "Used it for a while to prevent stretch marks during my pregnancy. I like it and to me it smells fine. Im sure without it my stretch marks would have been worse (I only have a few and not too bad at all), but I will say before this product, I was using coconut oil as often as possible and no stretch marks had appeared yet. When I started using bio-oil I stopped using the coconut oil and a few weeks in, stretch marks appeared. I'm not sure if it was because I was getting bigger or if the coconut oil helped my skin more than this product. Either way I still have half a bottle left and I will continue to use it in hopes it will make my stretch marks less visible. If so I will update my review. Hope this helps.\n",
            "The love the fragrance.  Goes on oily, but doesn't leave skin greasy or oily.  Very satisfied with the results.  Had hip replacement in May 2020.  Wish I had known about this then.\n",
            "This is a must for me for when I’m having skin issues especially for my eczema. You just need to be very patient to see results but it will definitely lighten up dark spots or for me personally, if I apply this right away to new scars, I noticed that it will be completely gone in weeks. This is actually second bottle.\n",
            "I'm fairly certain this is a counterfeit product. The box was damaged and not sealed, and it even says \"Do Not Use Product if Seal is Broken\". I'm pretty disappointed as I was hoping to use this on facial scars from a recent dog attack.\n",
            "I've been using bio oil on my face for 5 yrs now. I use it now in place of facial moisturizer. I usually clean my face with water and a wash cloth. I apply Bio oil after washing, or showering. After it absorbs, I apply my Foundation makeup like usual. I feel like it helps with age spots, scarring, blemishes, and wrinkles. It has been great. The only thing I don't like is the light smell. And this new bottle, I just got, smells like maybe the formula has changed, because the smell is a little stronger this time. It's not my favorite, but something I know I will get used to.\n",
            "Love the smell!! Easy to use and is recommended in a lot of blogs/videos when you look up how to treat damaged skin or stretch marks. I’ve lost a significant amount of weight and I’m trying to take better care of my skin. This product is great and affordable and works great with other skin care products.\n",

I haven't noticed much of a difference yet but, I'm going to keep using this.  I'll update my review laterm\n",
            "This has been one of favorite skin products for years now. It's helped the look of my stretch marks signficantly, it helps with the texture and redness and they are barely noticeable anymore. It helps so much with acne marks and scars on my legs, I put it on when I get razor burn to prevent hyperpigmentation. I wear it to bed but it's light enough to wear during the day. It's fragrant but not overwhelming, smells like lavender and rosemary to me.\n",

It is very watery as well compared to the one from Walgreens . Go to a store and buy the real thing !\n",

I was really looking forward to this helping me out with some scars etc. I thought it'd work much better & for how long I've been using it.... Idk, if I'm doing something wrong... I follow directions. Etc. Idk, I'll cont. Ato use it & see what happens......\n",

I know this product well and that is why I am a long time customer. I usually buy this at my Walmart store, but now I am shopping from #Amazon because I need large sizes now.\n",
            "This product is simply amazing.  I have very sensitive skin and I'm currently pregnant.  All my stretch zone areas were itchy and driving me crazy until I started using this.  I put it on every night before I go to bed.  My skin is so soft and not itchy at all.  I try to remember to put it on in the morning too, but I'm usually in such a rush that I forget.  I read somewhere that this is what Princess Kate used and she didn't get any stretch marks.  I'm 30 weeks pregnant and I don't have any new stretch marks, only old ones that have kind of showed up a little more prominently.\n",
            "I use this product for my growing belly to avoid stretch marks. It's not oily and doesn't feel sticky like other oil product and I really love the feel and texture of it. The scent is so nice. Would be nice if this product is more clean or organic.\n",
            "I have severely dry skin (face) and this is \"it\" for me. Feels great, soaks in, smells divine. I think it is really helping my dry skin. I don't like to use a bunch of stuff, am a pretty low maintenance gal, and this - combined with a few drops of Vitamin C - seems to be the golden ticket for me. Give it a try! I even rub any leftover on my hands through my hair. xoxo\n",

Im 2 weeks away from being 9 months pregnant and I havent gotten a single stretch mark yet. my sister in law told me this is what she used so thats why I got it cuz she only has ONE stretch mark from each pregnancy so so far she only have 2 marks per her two pregnancies.\n"

I have very sensitive skin and it does not irritate it at all (in fact, has often helped sensitive patches). It soaks in fairly quickly for an oil in my opinion. I don’t love the scent but it is very mild and the benefits far outweigh the need for a scent.\n",
            "I used this in conjunction with Burt's Bees Belly Butter. This oil was recommended to me by a friend that used it during her pregnancy. I started using it around 24 weeks pregnant and I am now 28 weeks. Personally, I despise oily things on my skin, but I was hoping this would be worth using to prevent from getting stretch marks. Sadly, while it does make skin feel soft, I ended up developing stretch marks during this time. When I started I didn't have any. Maybe if I had started using it earlier this wouldnt have happened?\n",

            "This product doesn’t help get rid of scars. I watched a video promoting it so I said I should give it a try. I don’t see how the ingredients would help and overall wouldn’t recommend.\n",
            "I have been using this on my legs in hopes to lighten scarring from years of trichotillomaina. I use it once in the morning and wear socks over the application and again in the evening before bed. It has done a good job of lightening the older scars and keeping the skin and current scabs soft. It's embarrassing to live with the scars and red, angry marks but this has been doing a good job clearing it up for me. I am almost done with two weeks of daily application and I am looking forward to springtime when I can expose my legs with less shame and less scarring. I would recommend this to anyone suffering from self conscious scarring looking for an answer to clearing up their skin.\n",
            "I've had a long history with bio oil for scars and stretch marks. This product works magic when it comes to that. I use it everyday and it definitely pays off. It is on the expensive side but I would buy it over and over again. I've told my friends who got pregnant to use this and all of them have only good things to say about this product.\n",
            "I bought this during both of my pregnancies. I started using this during my second trimester like the bottle suggested, but unfortunately I still got a few stretch marks at 8 1/2 months pregnant. Everywhere I've heard, stretch marks are genetic and are inevitable no matter what you use. So I can't really speak too negatively of this product as I don't think any product would have completely prevented them.That being said I still like this product. My skin got really itchy while pregnant and using this definitely helped and made my skin feel so soft. Yes, it's pricey, but for me it lasted a  long time. I had plenty left after pregnancy and still continued to use them on stretch marks to help fade them. After awhile you could barely see them anymore.\n",
            "I would recommend this to anyone pregnant.  I heard about this from friends who praised its effects.  I lathered this on multiple times per day and, even after gaining 50 lbs during pregnancy, walked away with zero stretch marks.\n",
            "I think this product is okay. The instructions say to apply twice a day for 3 months to see results. I’ve been applying twice a day for about 2 weeks and think I can tell a slight improvement in the stretch marks. However, the bottle is almost gone and will like only last another week. It is VERY messy, it takes a long time to absorb into your skin and leave residue all over the bathroom counter. The product may work long term but to me wasn’t worth the mess. I will not be ordering again, wouldn’t recommend.\n",
            "I have really sensitive skin, Ive been usingthis oil since my second trimester as instructed, and its been wonderful. Im currently 36 weeks pregnant and I don't even have 1 stretch mark in my belly, compared to other places where I haven't been using the oil. This is my second bottle and I can definitely see the changes in my current stretch mark as well, they are fading.. I hope they keep fading.\n",

It’s been a week and a half since I stopped using it and the rash has finally went away but still itches pretty bad.

I apply the oil almost every day and after two weeks there was a major difference. I did notice if you stop using it for a while they will come back but not as dark, so I recommend to keep using it. Bio oil smells nice but it is pretty heavily scented, also it takes a few minutes to dry. I still love it though\n",

            "Amazing! Struggled with acne for a while and I was left with bad scars on my cheeks but everything I’ve tried made me breakout. I never felt comfortable in public without makeup. I’ve only been using bio-oil for 1.5 months and my scars and skin have improved so much. I can finally go in public without makeup and it has even improved the terrible bagS under my eyes. Highly recommend for people with sensitive skin.\n",

It has a good smell , I instantly had nostalgia when I smelled it because I knew I had used this when I was younger . I’m not sure if it supports sensitive skin but you can always research it . Definitely recommend this product as a moisturizer\n",
            "I've been using this for a few months and see no difference in my stretch marks and skin. It just doesn't seem to work for me. It might work for others. Everyone is different. It has a very weird smell to it and I'm not really happy with it.\n",
            "Light clean scent to this body oil.  Excellent for scars.  It erases the look of dark scars.  It does not happen overnight but diligent use twice a day and you will begin to see a difference in 3 weeks.  By 3 months time there is a significant difference.  Highly recommend this product!\n"

            "The \"holy grail\" product to prevent pregnancy stretch marks so I bought this as soon as I found out.  I purchased this along with the Burt's Bees Mamma Bee Belly Butter.  I have enjoyed using both together or separate depending on how I was feeling that day before bed.  The Bio Oil really absorbs quickly into the skin so you dont have to worry too much but I also use a small amount so its not messy.  I also love the fragrance.\n",
            "I'm 27 and still struggling with acne and the scarring that comes with it. After one use of this over night I was pretty shocked the next day, my skin texture and acne itself looked noticeably better. It's now been only three days since I've been using this before bed time and I'm just amazed how clear, how soft, and how it's less oily my skin is throughout the day. Only slightly negative thing is I'm just not crazy about the smell, reminds me of an older ladies perfume because of the rose in it. Regardless this stuff is awesome and cant wait to see the out come of using it long term!\n",
            "LOVE the smell of this stuff. It smells like I just got through a day at a luxury spa. It really helps me sleep (the smell alone). It goes on smooth, love the consistency of this stuff and that it doesn't leave you goopy at all. Using it for all the intended purposes....i hear all good things about it, but i'll use it for the moisturizing benefits and the smell alone even if it doesn't work on any of my marks.\n",
            "I have to be honest. I’m not a big fan of BioOil. I used it once and decided to use coconut oil instead for scar treatment. It soaks in nicely and didn’t leave me feeling like a greaseball. I just prefer to use more natural products. I’m also not sure about the safety of this product. I’ve read so many conflicting studies and reviews so I just don’t feel comfortable using it.\n",
            "Ive been using this since the first week of my second trimester. Im now 7.5 months pregnant and I dont have a single stretch mark. I LOVE this product.It says to use twice a day but I only put it on at night before bed because it is a little oily but 100% does the trick.\n",
            "Used this thru both my pregnancies and did not get any stretch marks! I am prone to scaring and stretch marks and this really works. I love that it doesn’t leave any oil on your clothes and leaves you feeling soft and not greasy.\n",
            "rich oil that disappears quickly, in process of using it on scares on my palms, but smells like cinammon and hot sause. dont see results as yet as described on label, its been a month,will keep trying,\n",
            "Smells great and absorbed fast. I have sensitive skin and use it as a face moisturizer, on scars and stretch marks. I bought a small bottle of this to see if I like it and in two weeks I could tell a slight difference so I bought a bigger bottle.\n",
            "This body oil absorbs quickly and is hydrating. I haven't been using it long enough to write a review about how effective this is on stretch marks, but I will update my review once I know. Hope this was helpful.\n",

Since it worked so well, I tried it on some scars from a leg surgery and has greatly reduced them as well and have lightened them up.  I continue to use it because it helps my skin stay so soft and the smell is great and not so over powering and is very light.\n",

Lasts a while, totally worth the money. I also have very sensitive skin and this did not harm me one bit it just helped me. I will forever purchase this product.

I used it everywhere as I know women who had stretch marks on other areas of their bodies due to weight gain in pregnancy. I only had two small regions of stretch marks on my lower abdomen (thankful). Now, the stretch marks are close to my skin tone. Maybe it is nature, but I feel like this works. I don’t like the smell, but it doesn’t last. It is an oil, but the product was usually already absorbed in my skin before I put on my clothes.\n",
            "I guess this product is mainly used to reduce the appearance of scars - I didn't get it for that purpose, so perhaps it is a bit lost on me. It moisturizes well but I admit I don't like the rose scent, which lingers so I've stopped using it for my face. It absorbs well, tho.\n",
            "I wanted buy this for my granddaughter who's approaching puberty to help prevent stretch marks. I wanted to try it before I gave it away. I'm 61 & have very dry skin. I used it on my face at night after cleansing. It would be fine for me to use under a moisturizer. It's also recommended for scar treatment. I work for plastic surgeons & recently a recovered patient who's surgical scars had faded very well & quickly, stated she used it & Vit E. I think it's great for both applications. I gave the remainder of the bottle to my 12 year old granddaughter to use for scar treatments for minor cuts & scraps & told her mother to tell her to use it on her breast & hips when she started to grow in those areas during puberty. I plan to order another bottle to replace that one to keep for my cuts & scrapes, etc. It has very little scent if any & goes on the skin nicely. I would & have recommended it to others.\n",
            "I have slightly sensitive and dry skin so I was a but nervous to try this but I'm so glad I did. I use it on my face and my body and it's fantastic. A tip though - it can be a bit heavy (at least for summer) if you apply it directly from the bottle to your face so what I do is get my hands a bit damp with water (or not completely dry it after cleansing) then put it on my hands, run them together then apply.\n",
            "I had a csection 8 months ago and I use this on my scar whenever it gets itchy. It not only makes it feel immediately better, it doesn’t itch for a few days after! And my scar looks amazing. I can hardly tell that it’s there\n",
            "After plastic surgery, this oil is amazing for healing as well as softening !\n",
            "I’ve had this product for about a week and I’m hooked. I will never be without this ever again nor will I ever travel without it. The first night I had it, I lathered my post pregnancy belly with it and my face and went to bed. I woke up the next morning in complete shock. My face was glowing and I noticed a difference in my stretch marks (I also slept in a sweat belt). I honestly hate that I didn’t buy this years ago.\n",
            "I just received this item so I can’t speak for the long term results yet but this product does smell very good and it feels so moisturizing already. I’ve heard nothing but good things about this product so I will be using throughout my entire pregnancy I am currently 5 months so I’m hoping for no stretch marks at the end of it.\n",

I did use a home made mix of cocoa butter/coconut oil at night every day with it. Whatever it was, I had my baby and did not have a single stretch mark. Not sure if it was the oil, the butter mix or working out, but I didnt have any stretchmarks, and I liked how this oil felt on my skin. It wasn't greasy to stay on my clothes (i would use it after the shower in the morning, and would soak the excess with papertowell before dressing). Like the smell of it (you know how some smells irritate you during pregnancy). If I ever get pregnant again, this will be the first thing i get.\n",

I started applying this bio oil and started to see a change and fading of the marks in weeks. No, they are not gone and no they will never go away but now I am no longer self conscious of them! I occasionally use this on my face and have noticed a reduction in the appearance of acne scars.\n",
            "I bought this for a very long scar on my arm I got from an industrial oven. The scar was probably an inch or two long and just after a few weeks of using it once a day, I’m impressed!! The scar is almost gone!! I’m very happy with this product!\n",
            "I purchased this to try to fade the appearance of stretch marks in between my thighs and on my hips. I liked that it made my skin feel moisturized without being too slick. It was a nice consistency and the smell was okay. However, after about a month of use, I don't see any difference. If anything, one spot seems to have gotten darker and more obvious. The product hasn't done anything to help in the way it was intended, so pretty disappointed. I guess I'll finish the bottle, but won't be reordering.\n",

So the fact that I’m 60 pounds heavier now and still growing without a single mark is amazing. I use this twice a day now that I’m showing sometimes more if I shower in the middle of the day but I’m a firm believer in bio oil.

            "In terms of moisturizing then this product is a yes. i used it ad nights and love how it made my skin feel. It didn't afde any of my dark marks even though I used it for 3 months. I would still use it because my it evened my skin tone and made my skin texture smoother.\n",
            "LOVE this product. have been using to help reduce stretch marks with pregnancy. ofcourse i have some but its not too bad. I put it on my entire body after my shower. Usually i get eczma with the cool weather coming in but havent had any since ive been using this. Keeping my body nicely moisturized! deffinately recommend to others!\n",

            "I never thought I would put oil on my face, but I absolutely love this stuff! I have been using it almost every night and I'm seeing a huge change in my complexion as far as a much more even skin tone.  Have a also had friends use on their belly during pregnancy.\n",
            "I don’t know if it’s working yet...I’m in my second trimester so stretch marks are super common for me. But I’m committed to using it daily. My marks are super light so i don’t want to imagine what they could look like without using this oil. It has a wonderful and kind of calming scent. It’s also gentle. I bought a big bottle and am surprised that it actually lasted two months...I’m kind of heavy handed\n",

This does not make any of this things worst and I have seen a lot of my stretch marks and scars fade. I've been using for about a year. I just bought a small bottle for my sister and she's pregnant and said she loved how it absorbed in her skin and made her skin feel. I do use this in every part of my body and it works wonders for my dehydrated skin but I still do use other moisturizers with it.\n",

I use it as a moisturizer but again greasey, maybe I need to add it in with a normal moisturizer.  I  have been rubbing this on very old strectch  marks it would be a miracle if this helped.\n",
            "I had a beauty mark removed last year that left a scar, and since I’ve been using this oil - the scar is fading and smoother. I applied it twice a day every day for almost 4 months now. I’m glad Amazon had the big bottle of this. I also have sensitive skin, and it hasn’t made me break out. If anything, my skin is softer.\n",
            "On my second bottle now. I haven’t seen a different in color with the way it “heals” stretch marks, but at 8 months pregnant currently i can say my belly does not ever itch because I apply 2 times daily and it keeps my skin feeling great.\n",

            "Been using this daily, twice a day, for my pregnant belly! I love it! I feel like since I use it often it’s definitely running out fast but I love how it feels and how non greasy it is! Low scent and long lasting! It’s perfect!\n",
            "I didn't notice until later that it has mineral oil as main ingredient, which causes clogged pores and isn't good for skin. However, if you're just using it specifically for a scar somewhere, it shouldn't cause complications. I just wouldn't use on face unless you minimally mix is with another product, or even coconut oil or similar.It takes a while to work but I would suggest using it twice per day and for about 2-3 months, daily.\n"

I use it on my face even though most oils cause MAJOR breakouts. Overall, I recommend.\n",

It won’t be until 3 months so see dramatic results, just be patient. No doubt this will work. Smells great and fresh great on my skin.\n",

I used to have really bad acne but ever since i incorporated this into my skin care, i only get pimples once in a while and they go away quick thanks to this oil. The first week using this i noticed my skin was getting softer and looking glowy, after 1 month my skin just literally stop producing acne. even though i have acne scars they are fading rather quickly. The only con is that it makes your skin look oily but thats to be expected since it is oily:)\n",
            "I'm 9 months pregnant and purchased this product for stretchmarks. I was a little iffy about getting it through Amazon because of some of the reviews saying it's fake. Well, the box I recieved was tore open and there was no seal under the lid which is a huge red flag... Practically everything you buy now has a seal so that makes me nervous. I don't want to go through the hassle of returning it so I'm going to give it a try anyways and hope for the best. If you purchase this product, use caution and don't let your toddler help open the box because there may not be a seal on yours and oil isn't fun to clean up.\n",
            "Today is Tuesday, and it is the third day that I am using the oil, step in the morning, and before bed.  just perfect, I used it on my stomach before when my beautician prescribed it for me, for the treatment of stretch marks after pregnancy, and I fell in love ... it is very worth every penny.  as shown in the image, i took the first picture on saturday before using it, and the second picture i just took already to make a comparison and i'm in shock that it already gave this result in such a short time of use.  It's my right thigh.  I had to come here to show, praise and help other women find what they are looking for.  bio oil does not disappoint me.  I highly recommend it, 1000 stars! 02-04-2019 3:46\n",
            "I love this oil! I saw results fast. I was only using it once a day and saw results but it says use it twice a day. I highly recommend this oil if you want to clear up stretch marks dark marks the whole 9 yards. This works.\n"

That being said, I broke out on my arms & thighs like I’ve never seen after that using this product. Again, seems to work wonders for others but did not work for me. Hopefully, just because of my sensitivities and can work for all of you!\n",

I am 8 months pregnant and don't have ANY stretch marks... could it be genetics?.... Yes..... Could it be this oil...... Yes.... One may never know, but it's worth a shot! I also love the smell!\n",

Stretch marks or genetic so none of this stuff actually works for that and I didn't know that until after I had already purchased it. So for what I wanted it for it didn't work.\n",

            "I would say this is more of a body oil than it is a face oil. It smells like baby oil to me, very pleasant smell. My face didn’t like it, but my body loves it! I used it wherever I have stretch marks. Love the bottle, love the scent, love this for all over the body, just not face.\n",

I've heard some people complain about the smell but it smells just fine to me.  Apply before applying lotion or mix with lotions.  Use twice a day for scars or marks.  Use one a day for moisture maintenance and skin toning.\n",

The bottle itself is scratched as if someone took it and rolled it across a gravel road. Very upset by this. Scared to return, don’t want repeat.\n",

I waited to try this because it $30 everywhere else and I didn't want to spend that much if it didn't work. I wished I used this years ago. I was on steroids for 4 months and stretch marks suddenly appeared on my arms and they were the dark purple/red kind. Well I been using the product for 3 weeks twice a day but I stopped using it for about 5 days and they are disappearing. Most of them are already gone. I only have a few left.\n",

My stretch marks from my previous pregnancy seem to be less noticeable, still there of course, but less red/very light. My only regret is not buying the bigger bottle, I’m halfway through the 4 oz bottle on week 3 so not too bad!\n",

            "Love Bio-oil. It has a nice scent and isn't too greasy. The one thing I wish is that it was easier to dispense. Either I get a tiny bit or if I squeeze, too much comes out. Not that there isn't a use for more at times.The one use I like is to put it on bug bits or scratches, etc. to reduce scars and decease healing time. I add it to my face lotion occasionally and love the extra softness it gives my skin.I haven't put it on stretch marks so I can't say how it works on those for me.I put it in my body wash and turned the body wash very watery so don't do that! A little goes a long way.\n",
            "Love, love, love!!!!!! I used a belly butter with my first pregnancy and have tons of stretch marks. I am currently 32 weeks with my second and have been using the oil since 2nd trimester and haven't noticed any new stretch marks and the previous ones look a little lighter. Great scent and easy to apply.\n",
            "Alright. So I started using Bio Oil a month ago, I try to use it one, or two times a day. I use it for my face, since I'm prone to acne scars, and I've basically had them since I can remember. Bio Oil has definitely improved my scars, they are fading ever so slightly, and I can tell it takes time. But I know that when the time comes and they're officially gone it's going to be because of this product. It's \"oil\" so obviously when putting it on your skin it's gonna be greasy, I try not to put too much or if I accidentally do I just deal and let it dry on my skin before I do anything else with it. The smell is okay, it's not scented so it just smells like.. \"oil\" haha. When I use it before bed, I wake up with my skin feeling soooooooOooo soft. I love it I have dry skin, and honestly my skin has never felt this soft before. I've had it for about a month, and the bottle is STILL full. So I can tell this is definitely worth the money.In my opinion Bio Oil is amazing. I'm excited to continue using it and get the skin I've always wanted.\n",
            "I loved using Bio Oil with my first two kids, it’s been 5 years and I’m pregnant again so I ordered some and this is not the real stuff!!!! I am very picky about scents and fragrances and LOVED the way Bio Oil smelled. I put this stuff on when it arrived today and it does not smell like it used to. It smells more like old lady hand soap and the scent won’t go away. If looking for the real Bio Oil this is not it?l!!\n",
            "Omg if you haven’t tried Bio Oil you need to! I ordered it on amazon and it got to my house yesterday. After I took a shower I applied it to my growing baby belly and my chichis and it instantly felt so silky and it absorbed so well . I also applied it to my face because, between the weather and these baby hormones my face is braking out and getting extremely dry. It did feel oily when I first applied to my face but it also absorbed really well.Ok This is the best part, this morning after i woke up my face is seriously the clearest it’s been sense finding out I was pregnant! Everywhere I applied the Bio Oil feels so soft, I really feel like it’s going to help the elasticity in my skin .Thank you to all the ladies that recommended this product! It’s definitely worth trying !\n",
            "I love this product I’m just ordering my second bottle 💙💙💙💙 my skin is amazing more than before my surgery\n",
            "Im 7 months pregnant and I have been using this day and night from week 12. i also use it on my legs after shaving and so far so good! No stretch marks yet, but i have heard those usually appear at the end during rapid growth. I would still continue to use this in my bath fizz mixture regardless because it’s leaves an oil free feeling of moisture after it soaks in\n",
            "This is by far one of my favorite skin products. I’ve been using it for a year now applying only 2 drops on a thin cotton pad 3-5 minutes on my face after I get out of the shower. It has helped not only moisture my skin but help new bumps go away and heal all of the scaring on my face. I highly recommend!\n",
            "I have a big scar on my forehead due to surgery, it was still bright red three months after. I started using a foundation brush to apply it morning and night. After about 10 days I saw a huge difference!! The lines are not noticible now. I am extremely happy with this product.\n",
            "This smells so amazing. It's very moisturizing too. I haven't seen scar removal results yet after a week, but I would use it even if it never faded them, now that I've tried it.\n"

            "This will forever be in my makeup bag. I use it at night before I go to bed after I wash my face. I wake up and my face is fully moisturized. I wouldn't recommend putting it on your face in the morning just because it will make your face very oily. I am also 26 weeks pregnant and ive been applying it on my stomach morning and before bed and my stomach is so nice and smooth and no stretch marks. Highly recommend!\n",
            "I got this product hoping to fade some facial acne scars and lower body stretch marks. I have dry skin and have used many oil based products on it before. I put small amount on my chin for the scars and the next day I had acne popping up all along my jawline and an itchy rash extending down my neck as well.I will say that I used it on my stretch marks and there was no reaction - hence the second star.\n",
            "I've been using this every night on my stomach, breasts, thighs to prevent stretch marks throughout my pregnancy. I love the smell, its like a warm, spicy, luxurious fragrance. So moisturizing & smooth\n",
            "I bought the oil about a month ago when I was starting with my 3rd month of pregnancy.  Even after a month's use, I did have not seen any results.  I got them for the stretch marks on my tummy, but with the end of the 4th month, the number and strength of the stretch marks has started to increase. Overall, the oil has a good smell, but as some of the reviews say it does not necessarily work to avoid stretch marks and in my case it is not working.\n",
            "I only gave four stars because I haven’t noticed much difference on my stretch marks in the 5 weeks of continuous use after delivering my baby. I love the smell and it feel nice, also moisturizing. Just hasn’t lightened the dark stretch marks. I’ll update if that changes.\n",
            "There is simply nothing I dislike about this product! Biooil is SOOOOO good for my skin, my skin stays moisturized for hours! The reason I started using Biooil was because I have hyperpigmentation and this was recommended for me to use.. And when I did my skin became clear and its very effective the only thing is if you don't take care of your skin like your supposed to your skin isn't going to become clear as you would like it to. But I most definitely will buy again!!!!!!!!!\n",
            "So far I really love this oil. It absorbs well into my skin unlike other oils and moisturizes better than any lotions I have. I’ve only been using it for about a week so still not sure how well it really works on scars/stretch marks. The only downside is the smell is not good, but it fades pretty quickly. So if you’re not sensitive to smells I’d say buy it.\n",
            "I bought it because recently I fell and need to put something on my skin for my scar.  Still early to tell if it will help but the scent of the oil is so good that I have been putting it in my face.  It makes my skin so smooth.  So happy for it.  Another quality buy.\n",
            "I started using this product 15 years ago and after two months my acne scars and dark spots were no more. I'm using it again to remove new scars. It is greasy, so allow it to penetrate into your skin before getting dress.\n",

Also, I have oily skin in the summer, prone to breakouts, and I still use this product, it doesn't make your face extra oily -- before I started using I was nervous that it would make me break out if I use it on my face, it doesn't (at least for me)!\n",
            "LOVE this oil! Keeps skin soft and smooth. I used this on my pregnant belly after every shower and never got a stretch mark to speak of! Also works great on scars or just regular dry skin. You only need a few drops at a time, absorbs in easily.\n",

Once I received it, I compared it to the ones in stores and it seemed pretty legit. I started using this product, along with another pregnancy lotion for stretch marks. They seemed to compliment each other because I am not 38 weeks pregnant without a single one. I'm certain that this will reduce the chances of getting any stretch marks since it did ease off my irritation when I got the urge to scratch. I would just recommend you to double check that you receive the official version of Bio-Oil before using.\n",
            "I used this product during my third trimester of pregnancy and I believe it helped to reduce stretch marks! I just purchased it again in hopes that it will help to even out my skin tone on my face, so far I feel more hydrated overall even though it has not been that long. I recommend this product to anyone looking for an affordable oil to reduce scaring, stretch marks, or for basic hydration.\n",

There was one part of my scar on my upper arm that I didn't rub it on as much because and that scar is more noticeable there than the part I did use the Bio Oil on. I'm not sure what magic is in the bottle, but I am very happy with the results.\n",

It has a light fragrance, silky non greasy feel. I have read the rave reviews so I guess a lot of people got some good results but I didn't get any remarkable results. If you want a non greasy oil this will do.\n",
            "Been wanting to purchase this item at a near by market but they never had it so I resulted to Amazon.  The scent of this product is really nice and nothing citrusy (which I personally dislike).  Be careful not to over apply if using as a facial oil/moisturizer.  It absorbs well if you use the right amount and is suitable for sensitive skin with rosacea.  Overall great product!\n",
            "I’ve used this during the pregnancy. I did not like the scent at the very first time, but started to love it all of sudden. Perfect for my body moisture.\n",
            "Was recommended this product from a friend who used it for her stretch marks, so I decided to give it a try! While I dont expect miracles as my kids are now 4 and 19 months, I really do enjoy putting this oil on my stomach and giving myself a nice massage! Fingers crossed!\n",
            "I got this for my Mom after her knee replacement surgery and she said that it is really helping. Her scar is much smaller than her doctor expected and he was happy she chose this brand due to past patients having good results with it.\n",
            "This is great for scars and dark spots. It's a dry oil that doesn't leave a residue. It also smells good and will leave your skin smooth. This product will not automatically remove the scars or dark spots, but if you continuously use it, the scars or dark spots can become lighter or fade away a little. You should use this in combination of other products such as a whitening soap in order to get rid of the dark spots.\n",
            "Used daily during third pregnancy and I’m not sure if it’s this product, good luck, or because I didn’t gain as much weight this time, but I only have two small stretch marks this time. Unfortunately it did not erase my old stretch marks, but at least I don’t have the dark purple marks of past pregnancies.\n",
            "Obsessed with this (this is my second bottle)! After a week of using this my stretch marks faded significantly. I am only 11 weeks postpartum so some of that might be natural healing. It has a light and pretty smell. It can be a bit difficult to rub in/spread, but it makes my skin so soft. Sooo worth it!\n",
            "I was surprise because I’m not sure if it’s authentic. I still had some left from the bio oil I bought at target and compare to this one- this one is more orange and the smell is stronger.\n",
            "I really like seeing how much my stretch marks and scars have lightened over time with the use of the oil. I also love the feel of the oil and how it’s not too heavy. Second time buying this oil for myself and truly enjoying the results!\n",

I am happy to say that this helped stop the itching of my stretching skin and also, part this and part genetics, I have no stretch marks and my little girl is already 5 weeks old! I love this stuff!\n",

It says you should apply it in the areas of your stretch marks for at least 3 months twice daily. I have the stretch marks on both sides of my thighs and down on my calf. I've been doing it once daily (and sometimes I forget throughout the week) and I have seen great results. I've been doing this for a month now and I can already really see the stretch marks fade. I really do recommend this product.\n",
            "I was really excited to try this on my fine lines on my face. But it is def not for sensitive skin. I’ve never had acne or pimples and this have me huge cystic pimples. It worked great on my stretch marks in my other parts of my body so I continue to use it for that but wouldn’t recommend for face.\n",
            "The picture taken in the day time was exactly a month ago when I first used this product. And the one with flash is me today( a month later). It definitely lightened up my old scares that we’re a year old. Now my new scars are healing and the healing process is a lot faster with this oil. I have put it on morning and night and have only missed two days. My scars were also deep and scabbed so for them to look like this is good news to me!\n",

Great for areas prone to stretch marks and dullness (i.e breasts, décolletage, buttocks, thighs, shoulders) as well as helpful when adding a great sheen to the skin post shower and scrub.

I have only been using it for 2 weeks and I’m already starting to see results. They are not gone of course but they are not as red as they were in the beginning. I also have used it for my face for acne scars and uneven skin tone and seeing results on that already as well. I would recommend this to anyone!\n",

            "Not positive how well this works for reducing scars but it definitely reduces the itching from scars.  Three people in my household have used this product.  One has large scars from a burn, one has a scar from a skin cancer removal, and one has scars from a shoulder surgery.  Haven't seen a noticeable decrease in scar size but the product smells great and is excellent for reducing the itching from the scars.\n",
            "A friend recommended this to me. Was skeptical bc it wasn’t sealed shut when I opened so I returned it and bought else where but it was also not sealed shut there so  I guess that’s just how the company works. Used it throughout my pregnancy on my itchy growing belly and loved it!\n",

            "Used it on both pregnancy along with mama bee. Went thru 2 large bottles a month. Results- no stretch marks. Now I use it over my moisturizer at night, neck, and ant dry spots. Tried to save money by using pure castor, Aragon, and E oil..... can't compare to BIO.\n",

A little disappointing that mineral oil is the first ingredient.  When gone, I will go back to using jojoba, avocado, and other natural oils.  But this one is nice.\n",
            "I tried ordering this product before and it was on backorder for so long the order was canceled so after finally getting it after more than a year I was actually kind of disappointed I guess I just expected it to be more than what it was. I can just as easily use my Neutrogena light sesame oil and get probably even better results\n",
            "My wife is using on her belly and it seems its working. She has pretty sensitive skin and it seems no issues with it. I would like if the scent was not that strong but I'm good with it as it seems to do the Job. We will be continue to buy this Product\n",
            "The smell is very offensive to me. It says rosemary and lavender but all I smell is a perfume powdery scent and but not a good one. Maybe it’s just my nose but I can’t stand the smell and won’t be using it. I was hoping I could find it in a fragrance free but it seems there is just this one scent.\n",
            "This stuff really works at evening skin tone, hydrating dry skin and helping with scars and stretch marks. I use consistently and constantly  to notice a difference. Smells like Christmas my kids say. Absorbs so nicely not oily or greasy.\n",
            "I don't really have any negative reviews for this product. I'm still currently in the testing phase, this being my 2nd bottle. I got stretch marks from my pregnancy, mainly around the back of my knees and thighs. After reading the uses for this product I decided to give it a try.It does not have a horrible scent, actually it's quite pleasing to smell. Leaves my skin feeling moist & oily. I haven't noticed any dryness from using it as I did with other oils. It's quite a small bottle for the price so after rubbing this continuously over my body during my pregnancy I tend to run out of it soon.\n",
            "I bought this after reading reviews and recommendations from postpartum mothers about how this helps with scars and stretch marks. So far I like the scent a lot. I haven’t used it long enough to notice the fading of scars/marks yet.\n",
            "This really works. I had my doubts but I decided to give it a try and it’s works. I got a scar on my face in April and I heard about this product. I bought it and started using it right away. It’s July now and my scar has faded. I don’t need makeup anymore to cover it. It probably would have faded sooner if I used it everyday but I did use it at least 3-5 times a week. And the best part is that I haven’t even used up the bottle. I played softball so I have scars on my legs. I’m definitely going to start using this on those scars.\n",
            "This stuff!!! Wow!! I have very pale skin so even scratching a mosquito bite will give me a scar for a few months, at least. Now I know it seems crazy, but this started reducing look of a few scars on my legs in days, scars that I had had for a few months. It was incredible! Also I cannot seem to find any relief for dry lips, no matter what I try, but this stuff did the trick. It's an all around miracle product! Also, get the small one if you just want to try it because it will last a VERY long time and is a great price!\n",

            "I ordered 3 bottles. Gave 1 bottle a try. No difference provides no help with scars or any moisture.  This is a watered down product and I would like to return the other 2 bottles\n",
            "I’ve been using this product ever since I found out I was pregnant. It’s a little messy getting your hands oily; however, I couldn’t be happier with how it works. I love the smell. It completely cured that itchy feeling you get on your stomach while pregnant. I’ve been applying twice a day for about 6 months now. I’m 30 weeks pregnant and so far have no stretch marks. It makes my skin look amazing and I highly recommend it.\n",

            "This is great for scars and stretch marks! Works so well and it doesn't make you break out because it's non-comedogenic. It seems a bit pricey but it lasts SO long because you only need a tiny amount each application. I would definitely purchase again for myself or anyone who has a scar/stretch marks they want to be rid of fast! I would say give it about a week of consistent twice a day use to see results. Say on it and you will see a difference!\n",
            "I love this product and have been using it for 1-2 months during my first pregnancy. I don’t have any stretch marks thus far.  I use this before bed and wear a shirt over top. It hasn’t stained or ruined any clothes/sheets. The scent is minimal to none. Would reorder!\n",
            "This product is very oily, which makes me nervous when using it on my face. I have acne and am trying to get rid of scars, but am afraid this will break me out. We’ll see.\n"

It seems like my stomach gets a new stretch mark everyday, my breasts have stretch marks, and I just don't enjoy having that on my body. I use this product when I get out of the shower. You have to use this product religiously in order to get the results of less scars and/or stretch marks. They do vanish. The only think I hate about this product when you apply it, your hands always have that nasty, oily feeling from rubbing whatever troubled area you have. Other than that, it's wonderful.\n",

I use immediately after showering when skin is absorbant with open pores. Lather on to abdomen, thighs, back, buttocks, arms above inner part of elbows, and outside of armpit areas (front and back near shoulder crease)  to prevent stretch marks.\n"

I have some slight scarring from bad acne when I was younger and after a few months of applying the Bio Oil the scarring was considerably improved and my skin was smoother. I have oily skin so I was concerned about using any type of oil on my face, but this stuff doesn't make me greasy at all (and I use it before bed). Added bonus; I LOVE the scent.\n",

This stuff smells delicious,very pleasant aroma. I wish I could afford to buy a gallon of this stuff..Love, love,love this oil.Try it, you'll see what I mean. I originally bought it for my son to try for stretch marks on his stomach but after trying it myself on my face just to see what it might help with, I had to buy my own and in a larger bottle. I have been using this product for close to 2 months now and take it with me everywhere.\n",

            "I rated this a 3 because I'm still early in my pregnancy and don't know if this will actually prevent stretch marks in the long run, but so far this was definitely worth the purchase. The oil does have a scent, but I enjoy it and it doesn't bother my nausea like some of the palmers cocoa butter scents did. I also didn't find that this stained any clothing or bed sheets, but I only really used this at night!! Leaves my skin super soft and smooth.\n",

It doesn’t seem to do any better than my natural oils that I already have in my possession..  call the claims of fading scars and dark marks on the skin didn’t really happen for me. It’s all right, but I can do better.\n",

It smells terrible, like those scented bug sprays they had you use when you were a kid but you knew they were still just chemicals. In addition, I do not feel it’s moisturizing. Finally, there is no way I would recommend this for sensitive skin. The fragrance alone is agitating.\n",
            "It moisturizes in a feeble attempt to get rid of stretch marks, it’s never worked for me to remove pre existing ones but I’ve tried it, to prevent them and found if you’re trying to lose weight and that’s why you’re getting stretch marks, it’s not going to work.\n",

The discoloration is no longer there and the actual scar tissue is much softer. I Also on any nicks or marks I get that I don’t want to scar. Recently started using this for wrinkles (it doesn’t clog pores), and lightly all over my face. A little oily at first but it soaks into the skin nicely and you can pat away the excess with a towel.\n",

            "I only gave this 4 stars and not 3 because there is a possibility that what results I did not achieve were a part of my own accord and not the oil itself.I did not try this yet for the 3 months that is required. Atleast religiously, I have not. Therefore, due to the chance that it would have possibly worked, I always leave room or give them the benefit of doubt before slamming a company and their product with 3 stars unless I really did not like the product.Anywho. I bought  this in hopes to get rid of stretch marks on my belly from my pregnancy. I lathered this  oil on for about a week at most with no results. Obviously the oil claims to have an effect if used correctly for the 3 months. Stretch marks take 9 months to grow and appear. A few weeks will not improve outcomes. I am very bad at consistently applying creams for long periods of time. So my advice is, if you are like me and will not apply a product like this one everyday, then you best not buy it.This oil is not a rapid treatment. For that, you can get some mederma or other scar cream. Selevax is good too. Neosporin or plain oils and lotion can do a good job. Not saying this doesnt work, but it is not RAPID. You need to be consistent.The hype with this oil, I just dont understand. It is a good oil, with good ingredients  but that is just that. There isnt any miracle antidote in this bottle. Because purcellin oil, first of all  is just a made up name, similar to how doterra makes up the claim that they are certified pure grade whatever. No such thing.Just letting people know, bio-oil works, but only if used consistently and its ingredients are just plain mineral oil and other ingredients you would find in regular scar removal creams.On another note, it is very greasy and will seep through your clothes if you dont let your body dry before putting garments on.I do have to say though, it smells so good.\n",
            "I love this stuff! Heals my very dry skin and gets rid of stretch marks as well as any other blemishes! Helps skin heal faster too. I love that I could buy such a large amount. Doesnt make my skin extra oily either.\n",
            "I used it for two weeks to find out my face got worse and I started getting cystic acne. DO NOT USE especially with sensitive skin. I saw an article about it and thought it would do good for acne scars but instead, it took me three months after using this for my skin to get better and even then I have scars still present from using it. My best advice, avoid it.\n",
            "Best ever just buy it! Even though it's an oil it absorbs into the skin after few minutes. Doesn't feel heavy. Better than burts bees mama butter. Will repurchase this oil. Currently 34 weeks and have not gotten new stretch marks anywhere. Keeps pre-existencing stretch marks (on outer thigh) at same size. I can be lazy and not apply daily - still keeps skin supple for 1-3 days.\n",
            "Broke me out within a couple hours in a rash/pimple like thing. My skin hated it. I do have pretty sensitive skin though.\n"

I thought after a week I already saw some improvement on the stretch marks on my arms.  (These are my oldest and lightest scars) However within that same week of use my pregnancy stretch marks became incredibly itchy and I developed a rash.  I don't have sensitive skin either.

I had a total knee replacement in September and was using Bio-Oil on my scar to help with healing. I decided to try it all over my itchy legs after I showered after being in the pool. It's a miracle!!! No more itching. And it's working great helping my scar to fade too.\n",

            "At the recommendation of a friend, I started using this every day from the beginning of my 2nd trimester through the end of my pregnancy. I put it on my belly every day and never got a stretch mark. I never thought to put it on my butt - and I got stretch marks. I know they say stretch marks are genetic (either you get them or you don’t) but I think the proof’s in the pudding on this one.\n",

            "Its really good oil, I put it on my tummy every time after I took a shower.I bought two time for my two time pregnancy, my tummy doesn’t have the wrinkles. I like it and it doesn’t have bad smell. Good price as well.\n",
            "This product was recommended by my surgeon to reduce scarring.  I found that it is great for eczema nodosum. If applied as soon as a spot of extra-dry skin is found, Bio-Oil rehydrates the skin before the condition can develop.  A bottle lasts a very long time because only a small amount is required.  Skin slurps it up so there is no oily residue.  The very light scent is also nice.  I now use it wherever my skin gets a little dry\n",
            "After 2 weeks of using this on my face my HUSBAND asked if I was doing anything different because my skin looked so good!\n",
            "I love this bio oil! My skin stays soft and my face glows, my coworkers spotted the difference on my skin tone.It would’ve been nice if the price stays at $12, it keeps changing!It’s worth it tho.\n",

            "If you have sensitive, dry skin, or rosacea, this is the product for you! I’ve been using this product for 2 years now, and I’m obsessed. I use it for uneven skin tone and dry skin. It’s super light, smells good, and never irritates my face. I recently had a massive dry skin rosacea outbreak and used this three times a day and it went away in 2 days!\n",
            "Bought this a couple times throughout my pregnancy and have used it since! It definitely helped my skin. I won't say I don't have any stretch marks, but I do believe this helped reduce them and I still use it on my after-baby tummy.\n",
            "I love this oil! It works so nicely on dry skin. It is not oily like most oils. It settles into skin nicely and leaves you with smooth skin and smelling wonderful. I use this daily on my face and it works wonderfully. My skin glows and does not look even remotely greasy. I have used it for scars and stretch marks but I can't say it is perfect. Although I do think it has been helpful in reducing the appearance of scars, uneven skin tones and stretch marks. AND Amazon does offer the lowest prices for this oil that I have seen. (but shipping charges could change that) I have replaced my daily facial moisturizer with this and it is much cheaper then most of the moisturizers on the market and a little goes a long way!\n",
            "The oil is sort of thin. Not as thick as I expected.  It has an odd smell too.  I am using on a new scar from a surgery & don't see any results yet. I will update in a few weeks to post any new observation.Update::Been using only about 15 days now (2 or 3x a day) but it does seem to have taken the redness out of my scars!! Trying on a few older scars now too.\n",
            "Although the product claims to diminish stretch marks and reduce appearance of scars, I personally haven't seen noticeable benefits. However, this is a great body oil for moisturizing. It is light scented, greasy at first but then the skin absorbs it and the skin is left feeling supple and luscious. I have very dry skin and this oil is lifesaving for me. I sometimes mix it with a little bit of regular body lotion to create an emulsion for lighter hydration or to change the scent. You always need to wait at least 10 minutes before dressing.\n"

Can't comment on the stretch marks but this helps me keep my belly hydrated.I use it with Aquaphor Healing ointment as Bio-oil alone is only good for 1-2 hours but when I use it with Aquaphor I have seen a huge difference and both the product together keep my belly hydrated for longer period of time and I don't feel itchy all the time as I used to before.\n",

I can't tell you if the scaring is finally going due to this or to time but this really feels so good and my scars are now minimal. It acts very oily but it dries (?) and leaves no residue. That is to say while you are massaging it in, it feels very slick but then disappears so you could put on a silk blouse a few minutes after and not have it stick. Not sure how that works. Skin feels and looks lovely.\n",

            "I have been using this product for two weeks twice a day and it changed my face. The second picture is right after I got a scratch on my face and the first is after two weeks of treatment. I wanted something gentle since this was going on my eyes, and it not only healed my scar but also started to correct my dark circles. This isn’t just for stretch marks! And it smells a little like cinnamon!\n",

            "My skin is more towards the oily side. I don't get pimples very often and I'd like to think that my face is pretty clear besides some acne scars. I rubbed this oil on my face after washing my face at night and before going to bed. Within a few days, I had a large pimple on my forehead. I thought, OK it's just one..not a big deal... \"it needs to get worse before it gets better\". A day or two later, I got a huge pimple on my right cheek. Again, I let it slide. Also, as a side note, I was not PMSing or eating greasy/different food...just my regular vegetarian diet. A week or so later, I started getting cystic pimple/nodules on my left cheek. I didn't know WHAT the heck was going on and I tried to stay calm thinking that it's just a phase of using this oil and it'll just go away---I would just conceal the pimples with makeup and try to ignore it. I'm four weeks in and I'm pretty fed up because these cystic pimples on my left cheek look gross and I wish I never used this stuff. I decided to go to a dermatologist today for the first time in my life and he prescribed me doxycycline to clear up the bacteria causing the pimples and also gave me a dark spot corrector. I will update my post in a month to let you all know how that goes. I guess you can't always believe what you read online and all the crazy good reviews because I'm pretty sure my skin got worse after using this stuff because it's the only thing I did differently and my dermatologist said the same. I really suggest that you see an expert before you jump into all these natural cool products that sound amazing and supposedly work for so many people. I really wish this oil would have done all that it proclaims to do but it just didn't :(\n",
            "I’ve been using this for one month now, twice a day, and I can tell a pretty significant difference on how my stretch marks look. It basically takes the redness/purpleness away. I have less than half of a bottle left and will definitely be ordering more.\n",

I now use it on new handbags and boots before I wear them and apply again two or three times a year.  It restores old leather, enhances the shine, and seems to prevent cracking.  Light color leather may darken some but begins to lighten up about twelve hours later.  I do a second coat on wallets and bags where the leather folds to keep it supple.  If it came in gallon size I would use it on my leather furniture.  I spread it around with my fingers and my hands benefit from the treatment, especially cuticles.  I also rub some on my hands before putting on garden gloves.  I don't use it on my face as my skin is oily.  I buy it to use on leather, not on me.\n",

I'll keep using it thou to see if it ends up working and post another review. oh and it makes your face very oily.. I wouldn't recommend. you wanna get rid of ance and scars and stretch marks? I'd buy African black soap\n",

Worth a go if you're at all interested!\n",

I use it twice a day. I was 120 and now am 152, so I have put on considerable weight in my baby bump. I would highly recommend to anyone!!!\n",

After finding out I was allergic to cocoa butter, I knew I needed to find something that would help prevent stretch marks during my pregnancy. Not only does it smell and feel better than then cocoa butter- it works better! I saw a huge difference in my skin and hardly got any stretch marks! I truly believe this product made a difference. I am now using it post partum and it is really helping me to regain elasticity in my belly. Hooked on Bio Oil!\n",

It feels luxurious and like liquid silk. It has a very light, pleasant scent. I imagine that I'll be buying more of this product.\n",

Haven't noticed that it evens my skin tone out but I have only been using it for 2 weeks, putting it on instead of hand cream when I wash my hands. On my face I use it at night to moisturize as I don't mind the greasy feeling. I would buy this again, hope it evens my skin tone out eventually though.\n",

This does have a distinct scent but not overwhelming to a preggo's extreme olfactory nerves. It also feels great on the skin and helped my postpartum stretching and itch. My skin nosedived after pregnancy and was sooo dry. This was a great product. I also use it on my newborn for colic massage. It doesn't stay wet long and therefore is great for quick massages where I need to put her clothes back on. Plus it doesnt stain.\n",

No more dry skin, stretch marks stay to disappear and then the compliments start coming in about how I get my skin so flawless.\n",

I just kept using it until I got the results I wanted. I had to order it again except catch it during the pregnancy lol highly recommended!\n",

It will not make deep scars go away, but it really does soften them. I also use in on my chest for sun spots and overall discoloring and my skin tone is much more even. I use this in place of expensive face creams and it helps with overall skin aging, in my opinion. I use a few drops every night on face/neck/chest and a bottle will last me 9+ months. Great value for the price! It smells good and my skin in super soft.\n",

I really like the product. I use it twice a day. The only drawback is I feel the price is pretty steep for the size bottle you receive but I don't complain too much because the product works for what I need it for.\n"

I was also using it for a scar on my arm, it made my scar hurt so bad! The scar was healed but idk if it's because it's trying to hydrate it that it makes it hurt. But I just stopped using it all together.\n",

It is deep penetrating, light, not oily on the surface, awesomely gentle, very light, natural scent. We've found nothing this good, ever. Seemed too expensive to use as a body and hand lotion, but after the results on face and neck, and given its little amount for large areas, we began using it for everything. We rarely give five stars to anything. This deserves every star.\n",

I will be setting up a S & S for this product as soon a I see how long it lasts.  It is a very light oil that spreads easily on your skin.  A small amount goes a long way.  The \"oiliness\" seems to be absorbed rather quickly (just 2-3 minutes)so that you aren't left feeling greasy. I have noticed a smoothing and softening of my skin & a more even skin tone. I have one age spot on my right hand and that has faded quite a bit, but can still be seen. I only use the oil once a day and am quite satisfied with the results.  (Twice a day is recommended.) If it came with sun screen I would use it twice a day.  Am getting pleasing results with bedtime application. I live in Texas and can't stand a heavy cream or oil on my face in the summer months.  Bio-Oil does not leave my face plastered to my pillowcase at night.  Good on hands and feet, too.  Softens callouses.  Has a pleasant, light fragrance. I would recommend this product to others, especially 50-somethings like myself-- and older.\n",

Apply it on my scar mornings and nights for almost two months (only missed one night).It is a keloide scar so it was deep red at first, after three days of applying bio oil it turned like deep pink..... An improvement and I was happy so continue using it....but no luck for me, i have not seen an improvement and I decided to buy a different product.Bought Mederma, three times applying it to my scar and today I noticed that it has shrink like 20%, even my husband noticed :)I gave it three stars because I also applied bio oil to my face every night and it helped with my skin tone. I will keep applying it every night.I also applied it (mornings and nights) on some old stretch marks and I can see an improvement,  probably I am the only one to see it but I will keep applying it :)I guess it depends on your skin type and you need to try what works best for you..... Good luck!\n",

The appearance of scars was also decreased.  It smells nice, and although it is an oil absorbs well and doesn't leave my clothes and skin too oily during the day or at night.  I usually put it on right after a shower and exfoliating to help it absorb into the skin better, and I wait a few minutes before I put clothes on.  I have also noticed that my skins stays more hydrated and even looking.\n",

This in conjunction with a slightly messy homemade coffee ground scrub got my belly looking worlds better, and that in turn helped my self esteem and alleviated all the frustration I dealt with daily on account of the scars.Nine months in to pregnancy number two and not a single new scar, though one of the old ones is looking a little pink.Just be sure to give this product time to work its magic, I used it for a bit over a year before I decided I was pleased with the results, and then popped it onto our subscribe and save list as soon as we started trying for our 2nd.\n",

            "My friend recommended this to me for evening out my skin tone and removing the appearence of scars on my stomach. I had two surgeries, and so there are prominent scars along my abdomen there. The stomach was operated on the same place twice in 7 years, so to me it looked as if the marks would be permanent.But I started using this for about a week and as far as  my skin tone goes (face) - it is already fairer and almost even now. I also used this on my scars and because they are very prominent keloid scars, so I am sure it will take some time in seeing  any visible changes, or lessening of their appearence, but I am certain that this works...Slight fading of marks can already be witnessed by me. It may take regular application of this oil on the scars for may be a several months, before I completely see them disappear, but I can tell you it works. Slow and steady wins the race, remember?!I also love its pleasant smell! It totally gets absorbed in my skin, when I use it on my face, and my skin has a glowing effect, without being greasy or anything!It has clearly started working for me- someone who has visible surgery marks ( not even just stretch marks ), so I am certain it will definetely help you too!I highly recommend this, but you have to be patient with it, as it may and most certainly will, take time for visible scars to vanish, but trust me, it will pay to stick with it for a while and see the results!P.S - I thought I was never going to be able to flaunt a two-piece after the surgeries, but gradually, I think in the coming months, I will certainly be able to try that out ;)\n",

            "I use oil when I get out of the shower so my skin is already hydrated. This works 100x better than cheap body lotion plus it has a light scent. Will buy again when I run out.\n",
            "Very light and although my skin breakout easily (hormonal issues) this product has not made it any worse. I really love it and use it on a daily basis after washing my face in the morning and before I go to bed. It smells great! I message it on my skin before I apply makeup. It absorbs quickly leaving your skin feeling soft and hydrated.\n",
            "I use this product and my son uses this who has minor burn marks on his arm.  I'm not sure if it is helping, but it certainly doesn't hurt.  It does seem to lighten a scar upon application...but once its 'worn off' scars seem to resume their normal appearance.  Its been just under 3 months for my son and scarring has improved, but that could be just because he's growing and the skin is stretching and smoothing.Either way, can't hurt and it smells nice unlike other scar treatments.\n",

            "I got hit in the lip with a softball this summer and have a nice chunk of scar tissue I have to massage 2x day, which this oil is the perfect consistency for.  To start, the scar was discolored, mainly red, but after about a month of using this stuff it is now the same color as the rest of my face.  I have used it on other scars on myself, and my husband and have found it is a miracle oil!In addition, I have always had issues finding the perfect face lotion, as I am 34, I am not oily, but not dry...right in the middle.  I have tried literally 20-30 lotions over the past few years, from the cheap to the expensive, all seemed to have the same issue with starting off good in the first part of the day, but making my face oily by days end.  Although I finally found a face lotion I love, it is almost $100 for a small container, so one day I thought, why not try the bio-oil?  IT IS OFFICIALLY MY FAVORITE FACE \"LOTION\" EVER!  Not only does my husband daily tell my how much he loves how my face smells, I love how it does not make my face oily at any point in the day.  In addition, I LOVE the way it makes my skin look when I wear no make-up - it really evens out red spots and sun damage.  LOVE this for scars and daily face oil and will never go back to anything else!\n",

            "I purchased Bio-Oil a few months ago, to use during my dry-brushing skin maintenance routine. I have some problem areas, like most women-just some stretch marks, and surgery scars. I have certainly seen a change in all of those areas.. The Bio-Oil is very moisturizing, and seems to really sink in well. It does take a bit to sink in-you have to be careful, and only put a few drops at a time on, then work it it very well, if you put too much you can be greasy for a bit.I aso have the common condition, KP/Keratosis Pillaris...many people know how annoying this yucky chicken skin' can be-and how hard it is to deal with. I have found that, in conjunction with my dry-brushing routine (look on-line for directions how to do this-it really changes your skin for the better), the Bio-Oil has pretty much made the KP go away! Its so much better than using those urea based lotions, that are so gloppy/sticky and stinky!Overall, I have noticed that my skin looks better-softer, smoother, 'glowing'...the stretch marks (which are 9 years old!)  most certainly look better/diminished. The scars (about 8 years old) look softer, not as noticeable, I cant imagine how great they would look if I had begun to use the oil from the very start of my pregnant-I dare say that some of them could have been prevented, outright! I'm on my second bottle of Bio-Oil, my first lasted a few months, and I used it at least 3x/week. You don't need very much. I will most certainly continue using Bio-Oil, hopefully it will continue to make my skin look better. Oh-lastly-I have a little wire-haired dog that gets really dry skin as the weather cools and the heater comes on. He's been scratching his back like mad-so a put a few drops of Bio-Oil (just a few!) and rubbed in into his skin/fur, really well. Hasn't scratched since, which is fantastic, because he was driving himself and us crazy at night! I am NOT a vet, nor am I saying you should use this on your dog without asking your vet, and making sure that the itching isnt being cause by fleas or another issue. I just took a chance with this, because the ingredients didn't indicate anything that would be a danger to my little man, so, if your vet 'ok's' it for use and you have an itchy fur-baby, its certainly worth a chance!  I will (and have) bought and continue to use Bio-Oil regularly, it's a great product.\n",
            "I haven’t noticed any change in appearance of three different scars I have (two on knees and one on arm)\n",
            "It works I’ve tried so many stretch mark products and this is the only one that has worked for me.\n",
            "It works fast on stretch marks that aren't deep. it will take some time on deeper stretch marks. It does work but slow.\n",
            "This stuff is great. It smells really good and has done a great job of reducing appearance of scars.  I had gotten a rash on my stomach that left scars and would not go away until I started using this stuff. A girlfriend also mentioned she puts it on her face and took away scars from adolescent acne. It also didn't seem to stain my clothing since I was putting it on my stomach. Great product.\n",
            "Started using this product the beginning of my 2nd trimester. I love it so much! No sign of any stretch marks and it makes my tummy feel soft and smooth through this stretching process.\n",
            "I saw an immediate difference the next day. I have stretch marks from the top of my belly button down to my thighs from hip to hip. Also, TUMMY TUCK AND BREAST AG SCAR. It has flatten, gotten smoother and lighter. I love this product and highly recommend it. I am Spanish with medium light skin tone.\n",

It has a faint baby powder scent. Would be so nice if it were unscented. Otherwise excellent product.\n"

            "I've been using Bio oil somewhat inconsistently as I have scars (I'm Afro-Caribbean) from childhood eczema, volleyball floor burn scars, scars from self-harm...my skin's a scarry mess.Over time, it has reduced the appearance of my dark scars.I recently had surgery, and immediately, my surgical scar started to hyperpigment. I started using Bio oil on it once the incision closed and pretty much the day after (no exaggeration, I'm not a paid reviewer) the scar started to improve in appearance. The newer the scar, the better and faster the results will be as with anything else for scar removal and skin care.While I'm no longer using Bio oil on my scar (I got some pure lanolin oil from a colleague and that's working a bit better on my incisional scar) I plan to continue using it on my legs and now my face as I find the lanolin oil to be too thick to want to put it on my entire body (I tried it Bio oil on my face once and I didn't break out but it's pretty greasy, I'll only use it at night).And I think if you use it more consistently it will help. It also worked better on my oldest scars that had already begun to fade because of aging, so it seems like it struggles the most with very dark scars that are somewhere in the middle of the timeline. The eczema scars on my thighs are responding better than the newer and darker scar from eczema on my calf. I'm trying to get my legs to the point where I no longer have to cover them with Sally Hansen's perfect legs or whatever it's called, and hoping consistent use of this will get me there.Plan to try it to see if it'll have the same effect on my face and some new dark stretch marks on my hips that appeared with recent weight gain. I will probably update my review but I don't think I can bring myself to take photos, I find my scars so disconcerting...but maybe I will...for science! LolNot giving 5 stars cause it's not as natural as I'd hoped, but as with anything, the dose makes the poison. It's working, I'm not dying or getting sick so I'm not going to let a few chemicals scare me away. Everything is technically a chemical.\n",

It's gentle enough for my sensitive and acne prone facial skin and does not appear to cause any breakouts after applied. It smells wonderful and the texture is nice.

I used this as well as another scar cream so it was not a stand alone use, but the scar does look much better now between the two products.I do use this as a moisturizer on my face as it gets very dry and peels.

I'm still using the bio oil in hopes of allot more results in combination with my daily routine of skin creams, bronzer and what not, I recommend it to anyone who reads this, it's worth a shot to try it, seriously, added bonus, I put it on my face while applying it and my skin tone all around has evened out allot, my whole body has a glow almost, very nice, I only rated four stars because it consumes allot of time applying it to your entire body and letting it dry, it is pretty oily, but well worth the sacrifice I think\n",

I know I'm about to enter a period where I'm going to be growing more rapidly than ever, so that will be the true test of this product for me, but so far so good. I am prone to stretch marks (have them on the sides of my thighs and the back of my calves) so I am just waiting for the day that I get some pregnancy marks. I am pleased that I haven't gotten any so far, and if I last throughout my entire pregnancy without them then I will thank Bio Oil and my lucky stars!

Purchased after the fact, to prevent them from getting worse/help to lighten them. In hindsight would've been interesting to see if it actually worked as a preventative... Helps reduce itching, and moisturizes. Using on belly and now on breasts in case when my milk comes in, and they increase in size- worried my faint old stretch marks may worsen, or may get new ones. Also using on arms similarly, to prevent worsening of old existing old marks, since I've gained weight during pregnancy. I like the smell too, seems beachy and happy in a sense. Used to using lotion so not sure how much oil is suitable to apply to each area in order to be \"effective\". Just kinda gauge it by how moisturized it feels I guess... So much cheaper on Amazon than in stores!!\n",

You must have patience. It took two bottles before my stretch marks faded. It is a bit greasy and has an odd smell, but I don't mind it because of how wondefully it works. This product shipped quickly and was in great shape when it arrived.\n",

The oil created better elasticity as my tummy grew and as a bonus, faded scars from the multiple laparoscopic surgeries that I've had. I recently purchased a 2nd bottle because I just can't live without this product. In addition to using it morning and night I'll apply more when my tummy feels dry and stretched. Now in my 3rd trimester and only recently am I seeing signs of tiny stretch marks (they are hereditary after all, but as I can personally attest, can be staved off for a time). I highly recommend this product for prego ladies and individuals who want to lighten stretch marks or surgery scars.***The oil dries quickly, but you want to be sure it does before putting your clothes on as it can leave a bit of a stain.\n"

I have tried \"several\" expensive and inexpensive different creams and products and nothing has resolved the problem of dry, itchy skin in the eye area. Then I tried BIO-OIL and the after the first night I noticed remarkedly improved skin.  I apply the oil to my clean face at night and apply it to my eye area and face.  It feels greasy when first applied, but absorbs through the night as I sleep.

            "As an expecting parent you read all sorts of articles to determine what are the best products whilst trying to ensure you get good value for money. As instructed I have just started my second trimester and begun to use the bio oil twice daily. Hopefully it will help to prevent any stretch marks as my mother has some pretty deep and dark ones on her stomach and thighs. I sometimes add some palmers stretch mark cream during the day just to ensure that my skin in those stretch mark prone areas are well moisturized. I heard that's the most that can be done, keeping the skin lubricated! I'm certainly going to try my best to keep the regime for the entire pregnancy and keep the faith that no stretch marks appear! Can't hurt as I see it!  Will post after pregnancy with the hopefully stretch mark free results! Oh, the smell of the bio oil I like and it only takes about 5 minutes to absorb so the residue left in your skin is not bad!\n",

I am working on fresh surgery scars. The recovery has been slower than I'd hoped, and I've been using silicone tape alone. When I added this to the mix, I could see a difference in just one day. I am three days in now and the healing has rapidly increased. Why doesn't everyone know about this?!The bottle is also bigger than expected and will last for a long time.\n",
            "I have been using Bio-Oil for about a month now, with the hopes of reducing some unsightly stretchmarks on my thighs.  The oil feels nice on my skin, but I really looks like my stretchmarks have gotten worse.  Maybe I just need to use it longer, or perhaps it works best as a preventative measure.  I will keep using it until the bottle is gone though, and perhaps I will find a reason to change my rating.\n",
            "What can I say, it's inexpensive, so you get what you pay for. It has lots of mineral oil which is pretty much just a filler or an ingredient that coats the skin but it does prevent moisture loss. I've been applying it religiously to my thighs during pregnancy. I don't think that it's reduced the appearance of my stretch marks, but I do believe it's prevented me from getting more.\n",
            "I use BIO-OIL for my stretch marks and scars from unfortunate surgery. Over time the color got lighter and softer to the touch. I was on my way to the pharmacy since the bottle was almost empty. I, of course, checked with AMAZON and there it was in a bigger bottle which is a GREAT deal! When I run out I will reorder.\n",

            "I started using this early in my second trimester to avoid stretch marks.  I am now 33 weeks along and have gained 28lbs (all belly, it's huge!) and so far haven't gotten any.  I am prone to stretch marks and have several old ones from being overweight for most of my life.  I had lost 70lbs. before getting pregnant and knowing that I had developed stretch marks in the past I was worried about creating new ones. I did get a couple of rather large pimples on my belly (I am also acne prone and my skin has been horrible ever since getting pregnant, so maybe it wasn't cause by the oil) but in any case I'd much rather have a couple breakouts than permanent scarring from stretch marks.  I read a lot about stretch marks being mostly due to genetics so I thought it was inevitable that I'd get a bunch, but figured I'd give it a try anyway.  I use this every night after my shower and sometimes in the morning.  I also eat healthy and exercise which is said to help circulation and avoid rapid weight gain which also causes stretch marks.  I think the combination of the oil, exercise, and diet are all keeping me stretch mark free.  I have 7 weeks to go, so far so good, I'm keeping my fingers crossed.\n",
            "It’s great for skin and hair!\n",
            "I love this oil. It's not greasy at all and after using if for 2 weeks I noticed my acne scars going away. Not only does it help with acne scars but acne in general. I could tell some pimples were forming on my face but after using the bio oil they went away in a couple days. Cheap and affordable! I love it!!\n",
            "i got red spot all over my belly. It seems like allergy\n",
            "Love this product! Would definitely reorder. Gets rid of acne scars, while evening out ur skin tone. Apart from ur daily skin care routine, It can also work as a primer or moisturizer.\n",
            "Love this stuff would recommend to everyone. I actually have recommended it to many people already. I’ve only been using it one month so will do an update again in a fewMonths.\n",
            "I have stretch marks from two pregnancies as well as recent sterilization scars. I put the oil on twice a day and I've seen such a huge difference in only a month and a half! So many of my stretch marks have faded completely and my scars are clearing up quickly. Absolutely love this oil!\n",
            "DO NOT BUY!!! I can’t express it enough on how badly this messed my skin up even more; gave me black chucks of spots on my chest and worsened my acne. ITS A FAKE.\n",
            "I cannot say enough about Bio Oil. The best thing I have found for an itchy belly. I still got stretch marks though.  But it seemed to help minimize the and make you skin more elastic. I didn't not start using this until about 5 month pregnant too. I am sure if I started from the beginning it would have made a difference. It is expensive but 100% worth it.\n"

            "I've purchased Bio Oil multiple times and finally went for the 6.7 ounce bottle. I use it on my stretch marks from gaining weight. The stretch marks were \"fresh\" and it took my stomach to an angry red line mess to barely noticeable. Bio Oil does have a distinct smell, citrus-like, maybe an orange. It's okay, not a bad smell, but definitely noticeable. Bio Oil is a bit messy. It tends to leave oil marks on any surface the bottle comes in contact with. Which is fine, just wipe it up or do it in your bathroom. Quantity wise, I have never found myself going through Bio Oil at an alarming rate. The price is a bit high, but I'm expecting the 6.7 ounce to last me 2+ months, so worth it in my opinion. At the end of the bottle you can really stretch the use too.Now, keep in mind. Stretch marks will never 100% go away, they are essentially scars. Bio Oil helped mostly with the coloration. You will still be able to see stretch marks even with Bio Oil. Personally, the stretch marks went from a red-purple to a shiny white (a whiter white then I am and I'm pale as can be). Bio Oil also thinned the stretch marks a bit. I call this successful. They will never fully disappear and do not believe anyone that tells you different (with the exception of drastic measures).ps: I think the fact I was treating new scars might have helped make Bio Oil so successful.The only product I would recommend for stretch marks, I hope it works for you like it did for me!\n",
            "Has a great light and scent. Helped clear redness on face and dry skin/eczema on arms and legs.\n",
            "Used this every day on my belly while I was pregnant... and don’t have any stretch marks! I went through 1 and a half 4.2 oz bottles throughout the 9 months, so the bigger size would probably last a full 9 months.\n",
            "Works pretty good. I used this on stretch marks and scars and it did the job. It took a while until I saw some results but the imperfections did fade away.\n",
            "First off, if I could give this more stars, I would. I had surgery on my wrist, and when the stitches were removed, the doctor replaced them with some very, very adhesive tape. The doctor, however, wasn't careful in placement and two of the pieces overlapped and it caused the skin to tear terribly whenever I moved my wrist. Along with bleeding, and an excessive amount of pain, it caused the scar to deform over half of the length of the incision and, well, I was pretty desperate to find something to lessen the color and swelling.While I admit that a good portion of the state of my wrist now (Which is faded, and the scar tissue has broken down considerably) has been the act of consistently rubbing the tissue, I always see a color change from slightly pink (Or purple on bad days) to a much paler version whenever I use this, and over time my scar is much lighter, much faster, than any other scar that I've previously had that I haven't used this on. I've tried it with lotion over several days, just to see what happened, and it doesn't have the dramatic lightening effect that this Bio-oil does.\n",

I'm 8 months pregnant and even though I've been drenching myself with coconut oil and Burt's Bees pregnancy oil, my belly and breasts are still itchy and my skin felt tight. The moment I put this oil on, the itch went away and the tightness disappeared. A little TMI but I'm on day 2 of using it and applying 2x a day and I noticed my areolas are soft and supple whereas before they were dry and peeling despite the other stuff I was using. I even put this on my 2 year old's eczema on her arms and I haven't seen her scratch not once. I just wish I had this stuff when I was pregnant with my other 3 kids.\n",

Yes, I do still have visible scars after 3 months of use but I am still very impressed. So impressed, in fact, that I decided to try putting it on my face. I am 19 years old and have been struggling with pretty bad acne for about 4 years. Nothing I tried worked except for oral medications that my doctor prescribed but she was not able to continue prescribing it because I would begin to build a tolerance. I switched back to creams and the ance came back along with intense dry skin. I thought the oil would help with the dry skin and the old scars but I was absolutely amazed by what else it could do. After one use there was a noticeable change in my skin and now after about 3 weeks of using it on my acne, it is almost 100% clear. I highly recommend this for anyone who feels like there is no hope for their skin. I didn't think it'd work and now I swear by it.\n",

I usually apply it generously at night have have noticed a slight improvement so far. The directions say to apply 2-3 times a day so I am going to try and remember to apply it in the mornings as well. I will update after a while on any further improvement.\n",

I have never had a problem with bio oil and it has always worked wonders for me, but I will update this review on the results of its usefulness on the stomach when I hear back.\n",

I used it for about 2 months and saw no difference. As expected, the product is very oily and actually stained some of my clothes. After 2 moths of use I stopped using the product.\n",

I guess people might fear that they are heavy or oily on your skin,  but the good ones are not.  Instead they glide on easily (sometimes you have to warm them in your palm for a minute) should sink into your skin easily too.I like this oil,  it goes in easily and has a faint pleasant smell (some Declore oils are too strongly scented for me)  This comes in a plastic bottle which is actually a benefit,  because your fingers get slippery and I've shattered an expensive oil moisturizer before.  It claims to be very effective on scars.  I don't have much scarring but I do have uneven skin tone.  I haven't noticed a huge difference since using it,  but I have very sensitive eyes and they haven't reacted to this oil,  so that's a big plus for me.Edited to add that when I finished this bottle I did order another one,  so it's definitely worth having in the house for me.  I find it excellent during the harsh NY winters,  but also in the spring when I get hayfever and sore eyes,  and this oil is soft and pure enough to use on my eyes even then,  and stop them from being even more miserable.  So a happy find.\n",

They protrude just as much, no difference in that. One thing that Bio-Oil helps with is the skin dryness and irritation Mederma causes. I use Mederma at night and in the morning my skin is dry and irritated. I put on the Bio-Oil and the dryness and irritation immediately go away. So they compliment each other well, now if only they did their job.So if Bio-Oil doesn't work, why do I still use it and give it 3 stars? Because I know that scar products can take a LONG time to work. It's only been 4 months. If by this time next year I still have no results then I will knock those 3 stars down to a big fat zero :)\n",

It may have faded about 5% over 3 months, so not a miracle cure. However, Bio Oil works great as a moisturizer. I have used it on my skin after getting mild sunburn and it was very soothing and helped my skin feel less raw than a regular lotion. I am currently pregnant and using Bio Oil on my torso, 3 times a day (morning, after shower, and before bed). No stretch marks so far but I'm only 22 weeks along. My mother did get bad stretch marks so it may be in my future. I will update this review in November '16 after baby is born!Update: No stretch marks after pregnancy. I wouldn't attribute all my success to Bio Oil. Maybe it was luck, or the fact my daughter was born a week and a half early.

Even though after talking to my dermatologist I had learned that stretch marks are a genetic thing and if your mom had them it is very, very likely that you'll get them too.  The only thing you can really do is try to control the weight gain to hopefully get a small amount.  Anyway, I used it every day, twice a day.  At the eight month one stretch mark popped and then many, many more followed.  I am still giving his product 3 stars because it does function well as a moisturizer for distress pregnant woman belly skin.  It helped immensely when I was itchy due to skin stretching.\n",

I was a little skeptical, but willing to give it a shot.  I started using it in my second trimester, before I really started showing, twice a day, morning and night on my belly and sides.  I'm now past my 37th week and don't have a single stretch mark!Two down sides.  First, I did have some minor breakouts, not used to having those on my sides!  Second, I wore a dark gray jersey dress, I noticed a little bit of a belly print, kind of like a water mark.  It wasn't noticeable when I was out, but when I took it off, I could tell.  It washed right out without a problem.  Something some spanx probably would have prevented.I also used the Amazon subscription service and got a 2 oz bottle once a month.  I did have to buy an extra bottle a couple of times, but I was pretty liberal with my application.  The subscription was very handy!Overall, I'll take a few temporary breakouts to stave off stretch marks.  Well worth it!\n",

After looking up EWG's grade on the harmfulness of the chemicals and the product I decided to return it. Out of a scale from 1 to 10 with 10 being the most harmful this product is an eight. It states that many of the ingredients are endocrine Disruptors among other things and I would think twice especially when using this while pregnant. I try to avoid any chemicals especially while pregnant that could affect the baby's development and I am really saddened that this company is pushing this product for pregnant women when I'm sure they're aware that the ingredients are not healthy\n",

So far I've been using it for 3 weeks and am already seeing results. My stretch marks first turn red then lighten. I'm currently at the red stage. As for scars, I'm not sure it works as well for mine as it does my stretch marks. I'm now using on my face to clear up dark spots. Hopefully it works its wonders on those.\n",

I actually went to a chain drug store to purchase, actually had the 4oz. bottle in my hand and as I was walking toward the cash register thought, \"hey I should check out the prize on Amazon\" and was thrilled to see it for less than half the price!  I rarely (never) order from Amazon on my phone but in that instance, I used one-click ordering and it was on the way before I walked out of the drug store with my beef jerky and lip balm.As far as the product itself - it smells amazing, feels silky when applying, and absorbs quickly.  I have used it liberally on my foot twice daily for about 2 months, and the 4oz. bottle is less than 10% gone - so it goes a LONG way!  The scar is healing nicely too.\n",

I followed the directions on the package closely and religiously, but did not see much improvement over a 6-week application period. That may be because these are old scars, so if like me you wanted to try out this product to see if it will fix old scars, I would steer you away from this product. There are not many solutions for scar healing that aren't surgical, but this product would likely have worked better if I had used it closer to the original wounding.I do not give 5-star reviews unless an interaction with a seller was perfect and I felt that they went above and beyond the call of duty for their product by answering questions or otherwise accommodating my purchase.\n",

Some scars were bigger (closer to a quarter size) - looked really ugly and embarrassing.  I was running out of the med the dermatologist had prescribed, and the next appointment was a week away, so i started using this.  Wow!  Within 3 nights, the new dark spots are almost half gone, and the bumps are now almost smooth to skin.  The existing purplish scars have faded significantly, and no itching.  I am shocked!  I may not even need my dermatologist appointment or a refill at this rate!  I am using this at night now, for both my arms and legs.  I have not used it on my face yet (i worry about breakouts) , but i might try that at a later point - so far, i am shocked at how incredibly effective this is.  Far exceeded my expectations.\n",

It helps moisturize my dry skin better, reduce acne scars, and improve general complexion/tone of my skin. It also helps reduce the appearance my forehead wrinkles (I'm 23) somewhat.

However, now I usually take showers at night and then apply it, then wake up and apply it again.  I can't do it through the day because I work and I don't want my clothes to get that oil stain.UPDATE:  I'm 12 days before I deliver and I still don't have stretchmarks.  I apply it at least 2 times a day, but I have been switching between Bio-Oil and Coconut oil.  I drink plenty of water and I think its all of the above things that have made me keep away from the stretchmarks.  I have gained 40 lbs now.\n",
            "Let me first start off by saying, I started using (almost night) from about 10 weeks pregnant. I initially started using to help immediately fade stretch marks. Stretch marks start from the inside and there is NOTHING topical that will reach the depths of the damaged skin (you must attack that from the inside... ie. increase collogan in diet, etc). I did however think “well, if I can’t control the stretch marks, I can at least help my skin become hydrated enough to where it will stretch easier (hopefully reducing the onset of stretch marks) and then, once they do appear, I will be treating the coloring of them before I even notice them. I started applying religiously, after my nightly shower, once I started showing around 14ish weeks. I am now 36 weeks and still have zero stretch marks. Will I get them? I have no clue. But what I will tell you, is I have had ZERO skin issues since I began showing. No dryness, no itching, no cracking. My skin looks beautiful and healthy and feels that way. Needless to say, I’m so glad I stumbled upon this to use, not just for treating marks - but for the health of my skin. I plan to use it after I give birth in lieu of lotion, indefinitely.\n",
            "it personally didn't do anything for my skin.\n",

I use it from head to toe whenever I want an improvement to my skin or when I lose or gain weight and don't want stretch marks (fantastic for that) or for dry skin, etc.  Yes, it does go on greasy, especially since I have a tendency to use too much, but within 10 minutes or so, it's not so oily and eventually, it's not too oily at all.  I always have at least two bottles in our home, one to use and one for a back-up.  Amazon's price beats the prices our local stores sell it for, so re-ordering is simple and the delivery is quick.  Note: 10-6-16  Just ordered the 2 oz bottle.  So convenient. I keep it in the living room for late-night usage.  Besides being great moisturizer for my skin and reducing dark spots & wrinkles, it's great for cuticles.  As for the price online, I just went to Walmart and it was almost $5 more for the four oz bottle.  Glad to know that amazon.com offers it at a lower cost.Love it!\n",

Once the surgical site was scabbed over, I began using the Bio Oil and literally overnight the healing process accelerated. I have since began using it on older scars with very positive results. I just bought a larger bottle so that I can use it even more liberally on other parts of my body. I love the texture and smell, and the natural ingredients. It can be a little oily at first, until you rub it in. Highly recommended, not only for scars but for surgical site healing.\n",

It won't stain your clothes or be like Vaseline and be greasy.  Even has used it for bad diaper rash (very inflamed).  A friend used it on keloids from earrings that we accidentally ripped out.  Reduced the size of those by 80%, now they are not even noticeable.  If it's not working, you are probably not applying often enough.  Can't expect results using it once or twice a week.\n",

I also wanted to protect against getting stretch marks. I am currently 26 weeks pregnant. I have been using the oil once per day after I get out of the shower. The fragrance is light but takes some getting used to. I am super sensitive to smells but this oil has not been a problem. I love the feel of the oil; it glides on smooth and soaks in nicely and is not sticky at all. It easily washes off my hands when done applying. The itching has nearly completely resolved and I have not one stretch mark! I do believe however that stretch marks are hereditary and my mom never got them either. But I also believe that by taking care of your skin you can reduce the severity and number of marks that appear. I have not tried any other products out there as this is the first I bought and so far it's working great!\n",

I purchased it to help diminish the appearance of stretch marks,  I don't see a big change there yet but it does say you need to use it for at least 3 months to see a difference. A little goes a long way, doesn't leave you greasy.\n",
            "It did produced noticeable results so therefore I gave it 5 stars for working as intended. However it will depend on your own skin situation (stretch mark age, how well you hydrate, how often you exfoliate) on how you will see your own unique results.\n",

I'm using it on my face because I've been battling with dry skin and spots on my face due to my dry skin. I've tried the most emollient products I can find an nothing was helping, at all!!! Finally decided to buy bio-oil and I can't believe I've been suffering for so long! Can't wait to see the end result!\n",

I've only been using bio oil and \"strexderma\" for about a two weeks, so no real results yet. Time will tell and if I remember I will come back to update this review.However, I will say that I LOVE the way that it makes my skin feel and the smell is not bad. I use Bio- Oil in conjunction with Strexderma and Palmers Cocoa Butter or Shea Butter(depending on how I feel at that moment.)My biggest problem with my stretch marks is me. I probably could have \"minimized the appearance\" of them years ago had I been in tune with my body. I have a serious skincare regimen for my face and neck-- no blemishes, marks, or anything. Common sense should have told me to do the same with other parts of my body. Now, every morning and night I rub my tummy, butt cheeks, back of thighs and in between, legs, etc. with oil and cream. Those are the areas that we (well I can only speak for me) often forget to moisturize and most often the driest part of our body. As you read my review, rub the front and back of your thigh and compare. Notice a difference? Hmmm... Anyway, I hope this helps someone.I know their isn't a magic cream on the market that will completely remove my stretch marks, but it doesn't hurt to try. Dieting and proper hydration is also essential.\n",

The ingredients are all pretty good for skin conditions and scarring so I am pretty hopeful that it will work as directed in 3 months.  Like some other reviewers have stated this product does make the skin feel greasy and oil, but that is because it is an oil based product.  I wouldn't suggest this product for anyone who needs to use it in a very noticeable area all day, but you could try putting it on and then after it sits for a while take any excess oil off with a paper towel to see how it works.  I will follow up in a few months to give a better review based on the results I see.\n",

This is the first product that has diminished those radiation effects. My skin has stopped shredding when I shower.  The hyper- & hypo-pigmentation is diminishing. My skin feels like human skin instead of alligator skin for the first time in a year.  I have not seen any noteworthy improvement in my multiple surgical scars.  I have only been using this product for a month.  I apply it on my entire body but not my face.  If  it diminishes my scars or has additional observable benefits after a few months of use I will update this review at that time. Nothing else I tried had any noticeable effect on my skin.

I didn't have any stretch marks prior to 20 weeks, and I began using this product in the mornings after my shower on my tummy, chest, and hips (I continued to use the belly butter in the evenings).  I love how long this product lasts and how well it absorbs, so I started using it in the mornings and evenings around 25 weeks.  I'm 30 weeks right now, still have 1/4 of the bottle left, and no stretch marks yet.  I understand that stretch marks are genetic and you'll get them if you're meant to get them... but I truly think Bio Oil will at least help reduce their visibility and severity.  I got stretch marks from weight gain in middle and high school, so I've always expected to get them during pregnancy.  But nothing yet, although I have another 30 weeks to go.  Fingers crossed!! Oh, and this product smells good, too, which is important for our sensitive noises and gag reflexes. ;)\n",

I have used others products that don't leave the oily film, but they don't last as long and have to be applied more frequently.  The fragrance isn't great, but it also isn't horrible.

            "I started using this yesterday so I can’t confirm the results of the product yet, but three things I like: 1) the smell is very pleasant and I find fades away once the oil is really absorbed. It reminds me of a more subtle version of Avon skin so soft. 2) the packaging is good - there is a cap that only allows a small amount of flow so you aren’t losing most of the product by pouring out too much. 3) the oil is very smooth and leaves skin really soft. I rub it on my 7 month pregnant belly and then rub whatever is left on hands into my hands and they don’t feel greasy. They feel soft and moisturized.As far as preventing stretch marks, I can’t speak to the effects yet. I’ve been using vitamin E lotion the whole time, but this oil came highly recommended. I prefer the oil to the lotion - it just seems more effective, but that could be the sheen of oil playing tricks on me.\n",

When I tell people I'm 44, they are a little surprised... in a good way. Using Bio-Oil has helped me keep my face soft and smooth and I consider it my secret in staying youthful. Additional uses?

You can even take it to use for the Non-stress test monitoring instead of the ultrasound gel. For the final month (when you start to feel your skin getting tight) I slathered this on, waited a few minutes and topped with a heavier pregnancy sunflower-based oil. Much thicker and greasier.  This is the best for every-day. I now subscribe to this and use it as a body moisturizer and cuticle cream.  I wont ever go back to lotion or cream.\n",

Sure it is an oil, but I have to wash my hands multiple times after applying it to get rid of the greasy feeling. I use a cotton ball to apply it and still manage to get greasy fingers. Even just putting it on my scar, I only use it at night because I don't want it to get on my work clothes. I've never spilled it, but the bottle is also now a greasy mess, leaving a greasy ring on the shelf in my bathroom. My scar looks pretty nice after several months of use, but I started using this product right after the dermabond glue peeled off, so I really can't say what it would look like if I hadn't applied this product.\n",

I've been using this product for over a year and I would say that there is no noticeable difference in my stretch marks. I was disappointed at first but then I fell in love with this product, but not because of it reducing the appearance of my stretchmarks but because it is a great facial moisturizer! I would say my face goes through difference phases of being very oily and very dry. I've struggled to find the right moisturizer for that reason. This product however starts off oily and then drys on looking matt! It leaves my face feeling silky smooth without feeling oily (a little goes a long way). If I accidentally use too much, I just blot the excess with toilet paper. Some reviewers complain about the smell but I love it. It think it has a subtle floral smell which dissipates throughout the day.  I use this product in the morning and at night after I wash my face. Four starts because of it being a great facial moisturizer but minus one star for not helping my stretch marks. I'm still buying this product and will continue to buy.\n",

Lotions without oil just do not do it for me and my skin stays dry and can occasionally start to flake a lot.  Bio oil has helped with my dry skin so much, without causing any extra break outs. It's been a real life saver, and has even helped with my skin tone as an added bonus.Not everyone has the same type of skin, and everyone reacts differently to different products. But if you're struggling like me, it's worth a shot since it is fairly affordable. Worst case scenario is it doesn't work for your face because of break outs, you can still use it on other problem areas such as elbows.\n",

I use it more so because it moisturizes well, smells lovely, and to pacify myself psychologically into believing it's preventing stretch marks. I do have stretch marks on my thighs and it has done nothing for those. To be honest, the super positive reviews I've seen for diminishing stretch marks all come from fair skinned individuals. If you're darker skinned, you may be disappointed.FYI, I'm going to take before and after pictures with this new bottle for the new stretch marks on my belly (it's only two of them right below belly button).

I used this twice a day with my first child and am using it again with my second.  I have about three very faint stretch marks from my 8.5lb first child.  While it's super greasy to apply (it is oil after all), it dries quickly and leaves no residue on my clothes.  There is no fragrance too which is nice when your pregnant.  If I feel super full after a meal and feel my skin stretching, I will apply a little oil and my skin is fine.The price in the stores is much higher than on Amazon and if you subscribe and save, you can reduce the price even more.\n",

The same thing happened when I used the Palmer's lotion, so for people with eczema it is a process of figuring out what works and doesn't. But I can still use it on my face to even out skin tone and for dryness as well as on my legs for stretch marks that I may have there. I love the subtle scent it is almost powdery and I find a little goes a long way.

It's hard to get in the habit of applying but I keep it by my lotion so I always apply it after a shower (and again before bed). A little goes a long way in this bottle. Every time I look at it, I'm surprised as to how much I still have.On my surgery scars, those are already self healing so I can't 100% claim that this helps, but I fully believe it does! I also use this on my old stretch marks on my butt that has been there for years and I have seen them fade over weeks time. Of course they're not fully gone but they are not as noticeable as before.

I've never struggled with acne or oil skin and then I turned 28 and boom - horrible  I used all kinds of expensive skin care regiments. And it was just getting worse and left scars. That why I tried Bio-oil. I stopped using all my other products including the acne treatments. I use a Clairasonic with a Sensative skin wash before bed, then Bio-oil. In the morning I just wash my face with my hands and water and Bio-oil. Oily skin stopped within days and the acne scaring faded in only a couple weeks. It's seriously a miracle product. I still get breakouts but not nearly enough probably because my skin is super hydrated now. Try it!!! Bonus.... I use it as eye makeup remover. Amazing.\n",

I have some dark scars on my legs from when I have cut myself with a razor while shaving. It took about 2 to 3 months of persistence, applying twice a day at night and in the morning but they are almost completely gone! I also had 2 spots that were from breaking out and because they were newer scars they completely disappeared in less than a month using this! The longer you've had the scars the longer it will take to make less noticeable (especially the dark ones like I had on my legs). I would suggest anyone one who has scars anywhere to try this!\n",

I do like that it absorbs very well and doesn't leave much of an oily feel. The smell was a bit strong for me though, I have a strong sensitivity to smells, but some may find it appealing, I thought I smelled a bit like an old lady. I also wouldn't be comfortable applying to the face. I feel it may cause breakouts, but I have sensitive skin so it may work wonders for people with darker skin tones.I haven't seen much difference with the stretch marks yet, but it does make the skin soft. Conclusion, I would save my money and buy something at an Apothecary or natural pharmacy next time.\n",

            "I'm VERY mixed about this product. I bought it for help with 10+ year old stretch marks form puberty. I only used it for a month so I can't talk about longer term effects. In the month of use I did like how it made my skin feel. But I'm very mixed due to things I've read about the product.I like how bio-oil smells, I like how it feels on my skin, I like the great reviews. But I DON'T like the ingredients or the negative assessments of the product. This oil contains things that other products strive to keep OUT of their products (Parabens). And it contains almost no pure natural oils. The ingredient list is honestly a little scary. Especially since they tell you to use it while pregnant. If you look up bio-oil on youtube you find scary videos of people talking about how it is basically mineral oil and how that's bad...comes from crude oil etc, but baby oil is also basically mineral oil. So, honestly it's all very confusing.Due to all the research I did, I've chosen to switch to natural and 100% pure oils. I've looked up some recipes for skin/stretch mark care blends online (some recipes can be found here: [...]. I just feel better buying 100% natural and pure oils (NOW is a good brand) like, Grapeseed, Argan, JoJoba etc. and mixing my own blend for my skin. People have been using natural oils for thousands of years so I feel safer with those.I say, believe what you want about bio-oil...make your own judgements. I'm certainly not throwing away my bio-oil but I think I might just keep it as something I occasionally use for shoulder massages and things. I've decided not to use it on a daily basis though.Also, if your looking for really good natural products the 100% Pure brand is nice ([...]). They have lotions, soaps, cosmetics, Argan oil...but are a little pricey.Another great brand of organic soaps and products is Dr. Bronners. It's been around forever and it's great. I especially love the Peppermint products.\n",

            "One of my friend from Italy suggested this product for dry skin ant stretch marks. I started using it 2 months ago I am very happy with it. At the beginning of the third trimester the skin of my face started to dry very quickly and my moisturizing cream wasn't working at all. I started using this bio-oil and in less then three days the dryness was almost gone and after one week my skin was normal again. You don't have to use too much product, it dries very fast and it doesn't make your skin oily. I am using it also on my belly and it's fantastic. The skin is soft, hydrated and no stretch marks. I will use it even after the delivery in order to help to preserve the elasticity of my belly skin. I can't say for sure if it's the product or my skin, but I think it's always good to give a try to a product that may help to reduce or prevent stretch marks and annoying dryness.\n",

            "I absolutely love this product! After years of struggling with acne, I got a medication that worked to clear it up. I initially bought this to even out my skin tone from acne scars, but use it for so much more. First, even with medication and a cleanser that works, when I used my expensive Clinique lotion, I broke out right away. I was worried this would make me break out, but it doesn't! It moisturizes and helps even out my skin tone without clogging my pores and making me break out. It dries quickly enough that I can apply my makeup within 5 minutes of applying it. My elbows are always crazy dry, so I use this every day on my elbows too and it helps greatly. I also have a large scar on my leg from a dog bite. That scar will never go away, but using the Bio-oil twice a day on it and smoothed it out and lightened it quite a bit. I have been and will continue to recommend this product! It does say on the bottle to give it a full 3 months before seeing results. That's true on reducing scarring, but you can tell immediately that it's a great moisturizer.\n",

            "I purchased this in the hope that it would help reduce stretch marks that I have on my stomach. They are new stretch marks that appeared a few months ago from weight gain that I'm working on losing. This oil has a pleasant scent and isn't sticky like other oils. My stretch marks don't appear to be fading. I did apply the oil to a tiny scar that had formed from a cat scratch and it is improving. I've not yet decided if I will purchase again for stretch marks. I may for things like scars or discoloration from bug bites. This is a good product and I like it. I feel it would work better for preventing stretch marks or fading discoloration. Stretch marks seem to be difficult to fade. I will be finishing the bottle and will update this post if I have any changes.\n",

Anyway, I'm pretty sure the product works when used religiously and correctly, one day I'll use it right lol. I recently got a burn on my arm too from a chemistry lab so I think I'll start using it again for that. Oh also, if you are concerned about you feeling super slick and greasy, you shouldn't be lol.

Like a lot of women that have had children, I ended up with some stretch marks. My stretch marks are mostly on my stomach and upper outer thighs. I had seen commercials for Bio Oil so I decided to read some reviews and see what people thought of it. After reading enough positive reviews, I decided to purchase it for myself. I have been using it for about 2 weeks now (twice a day) and there is definitely a noticeable difference in the appearance of my stretch marks. I was a little skeptical at first because I've tried other products that haven't helped at all. Bio Oil is really working for me though, and it's giving me my confidence back!! I didn't tell my fiance that I've been using this and HE even noticed a difference (it has to be a BIG difference for him to notice anything... you know how men are... LOL). I definitely recommend that everyone with stretch marks and/or scars tries this product. What do you have to lose?! It's only about $12 with shipping and it works better than ALL of the high end products I've tried!!\n",

I also began using it on other blemishes and marks on my legs and arms ALL fading tremendously. GREAT stuff!!!!

However, I had a dark mark on the right side of my nose due to picking at a pimple. I used Bio-oil on it for like 1 mo and slowing but surely it faded away. Now it is non-existent.I am now using it on two stubborn dark marks on the side of my forehead (temple area). They are taking longer to fade away but they are getting lighter and ligther everyday. I apply Bio-oil twice a day to the stubborn marks and other parts of my body when I get out of the shower. The product seems too work, smells great and is not too greasy.

I love the way it feels on my skin, and I am certain it has helped reduce the appearance of some rather unpleasant scars and possibly even lightened my stretch marks a tad. I don't always use it straight up, for one thing I mix it in with other oils and use it before I get out of the shower before drying off. Then  I put several squirts into my body lotion and mix it up because I figure it can't hurt and again, I really like the smell. For a particularly bad scar or new but healing mark, I will put this on by itself before applying my lotion. I do think it is priced a little high, but I like it so much that so far it is worth it.\n",

Bio oil has, over time, addressed both of those issues by reducing inflammation and reducing the appearance of my facial scars (I originally bought it because I heard it was used to reduce pregnancy stretch marks, and I figured if it worked for those it would work for my problem, which it has). It also makes my skin feel really smooth and soft.Generally, I put the product on when I sleep or when I know I'm not going to be leaving the house, and leave it on for as many hours as possible. It's really oily and doesn't absorb into the skin, so it will look gross if you wear it outside, but if you can find a way to leave it on for a long period of time, it works pretty well.\n",

            "I love this product. It's always sold out in stores so i order on here. It really works at fading and removing scars as long as you follow instructions by applying it twice a day.\n",
            "It leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized I’m almost In my second trimester so hopefully it does wonders.\n",
            "This is really good! My kids acne is pretty much under control with daily use of this oil.\n",
            "Very moisturizing, but does leave you looking like an oil slick. Kind of sits on top of your skin until it sinks in, which can take up to an hour.\n",
            "Love this stuff\n",
            "Bio-Oil has such a great, fresh scent. It works great on scars as well as stretch marks. It reduces itching that sometimes occurs with stretch marks and it seems to help reduced scar visability.\n",
            "First of all, I think it's important to point out that although Bio-Oil works quickly, the most prominent results are seen after a long period of use. I often see many reviewers complaining that it's not effective after only 1-2 weeks of use! This is not magic - it's science. It does not work overnight. You need to adapt Bio-Oil into your daily routine. It takes minimal effort and it's incredibly worth it. Results will be prominent after 1-2 months of consistent use.After looking at the results from the clinical trials, before/after pics on googles, celebs who use it, lots of user reviews, the ingredients in the product, etc I was convinced to purchase it. Before you buy any skin care product, I encourage you to look at the ingredients! Don't blindly purchase things and waste your money - do your research on the substances in the product! That being said, Bio Oil is a bottle of goodness...lots of vitamins and natural extracts. I didn't see any ingredient that is *specifically* meant for anti aging purposes (these would likely be things like polypeptides) so I wouldn't rely on this solely for anti aging results such as wrinkle reduction, unless you want to achieve a younger look through moisturizing - which is possible.I apply Bio-oil each night to before bed time. It is a greasy formula and I don't recommend wearing this under makeup - especially if you have combo/oily skin. It takes a while to absorb into your skin..maybe 10 minutes.  I have been using Bio-oil to help improve stretch marks and even out discoloration on my face (some natural discoloration around my mouth as well as some on my cheeks from acne scars). In terms of stretch marks I can vouch that Bio-oil works. Don’t expect them to disappear all together, I’m under no illusions that my stretch marks will ever vanish, however this oil has drastically faded them to a point where I'm more confident. The discoloration on my face has significantly faded. My skin feels very soft and smooth.I suggest that you buy the larger bottle of bio oil and not the mini size, as you'll get more for you money. Overall, I highly recommend Bio Oil!\n",
            "Not seeing any changes in the appearance of stretch marks on my tummy unfortunately.  I am almost through with the bottle and will not reorder.\n",
            "Not sure if it's working on scars but it's moisturizing well on my skin with a great scent.\n",
            "Used this product many times in past and will continue to for duration of life! Works well, fast delivery, product securely packaged!\n"

            "I bought this oil about 1 month ago. I wanted to wait a bit before a review. I want to say I have bad stretch marks after my two kids. I was 110 before both of them now weighing 120 I gained 50lbs for my 2nd baby, leaving my belly destroyed. I have so many it's embarrassing sometimes but I u have learned to live with them. I have tried many products, to try to at least demish them, nothing has work. I have tried this oil and it seams to be doing a good job, they are smoother, and less noticeable, but I will continue using untill I have better results. So far it's doing very good. Definitely recommend.\n",

            "I went ahead and read reviews on oils to use while pregnant to avoid stretchmarks. I first started out with the palmer's cocoa butter formula but hated the smell and texture. I then went ahead and tried this and also bought the Mama Mio oil. The two oils are pretty similar to one another but I prefer the bio-oil to the Mama Mio oil as it is easier to wash off your hands once you have applied. The price is also much better for the bio oil. I would definitely recommend this product. I'm currently 8 months pregnant and have no stretch marks and only use at night.\n",

In an effort to address these concerns, I use Tazorac, an Rx retinoid cream, during the summer and a Vitamin C serum during the winter. Bio-Oil is a great complement to these drying treatments. It has not caused my skin to break out. My skin is very sensitive; I am prone to eczema and keloid scarring (despite being a pale redhead).Although this is an \"oil\", it absorbs much faster than natural oils like jojoba, which left me feeling greasy. It also has a nice rosy smell. I find this product relaxing to apply before bed and often use it all over my body after exfoliating in the shower.\n",

My Mom had stretch marks (8 kids). 3 of my sisters have stretch marks while one has none (she didn't use any products for prevention). I did start noticing a few little red dots on the bottom of my belly at 30 weeks, but as of today, they have not connected like a stretch mark. They still look like just little red dots. I'm keeping my fingers crossed and hope that's the worse they're going to get.The reason why I gave it a 4 star is because it's uncomforablly oily. I slather it on, then put a light tank top on, then my regular clothes and this seems to help me feel a bit more comfortable. My sister who has very oily skin did not like this product but I have very dry skin so it seems to \"fade\" into my skin after about 20-30 minutes. I use it 2x a day, morning and evening.\n",

They have faded significantly (more \"white\" than red) and I've had the hardest time getting them to diminish.  I've tried body butters, Strivectin, argan oil, tea tree oil, self-tanners, cocoa butter...the list goes on.Honestly, I've been using this product pretty regularly for about two months, and haven't seen a difference in the stretch marks themselves.  However, I have seen a huge improvement in my skin--Bio Oil makes your skin incredibly soft and smooth.  I started using it on my chest too, to prevent stretch marks in those areas.  For a night out, you can put Bio Oil all over your body--it will give you a beautiful, subtle glow without being oily or sticky.  It's replaced my cocoa butter oil completely, and even though it is a bit more expensive, a little product goes a long way.I love Bio Oil, but it turns out that I don't love it for what I originally bought it for.

I have very smooth skin after about 2 weeks of consistent use. Really inexpensive and easier to put make up on with smooth skin. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because there should be a sponge or some kind of applicator on top of the bottle so you could apply it easier with less mess. Right now you have to pour it on your fingers and then apply it to your face and it runs down my arm sometimes. Really greasy but the smooth skin is worth it.

My baby is 10 weeks old now and I am still not back to my normal weight, I still have 6 more lbs to go. Don't know if I'll get any once I lose those lbs.

It helps to really massage it in, not just rub it on. I will continue to use the oil and see what happens...I put on a little weight from 7 months bed rest and stared getting stretch marks on my arms I have tried the bio oil for about 1 month now and so far no luck in lightening them but will keep trying, I do have to say I am not as committed to the stretch marks as I was to the knee scar so I am sure that has an effect.

It IS an oil, so you will feel a bit greasy when you place it on your skin - but your skin will also absorb it pretty fast. Has a nice gentle scent.I can't guarantee that it will work for you, but it's certainly easier to trial than a $100 lotion  :) I'm super happy with it and I will certainly buy again.\n",

Did nothing for scars, pigmentation, or moisturization. I broke out constantly, and I attribute this to the mineral oil content. I gave 2 stars for the eyelashes, but honestly? Coconut oil does the same for them and is much cheaper. This might do what it claims for others, it just didn't for me. I am disappointed in myself for shelling out this amount of $.

I injured my arm on a screw that was protruding from a piece of wood and had a long visible scar (about 1\") after it healed.  I would use the bio-oil every day and within two weeks, it started to get smaller.  It has been about 6 weeks now and it is about half-an-inch long and is less visible.  I bought more of the Bio-oil from Amazon for other scars that have been around for a long time.  I will be sure to keep the oil on hand in case I may need it in the future.\n",

There was also a slight variation in the verbiage.My questions sent to the company through their website under the 'contact us' link were:Are color variations normal? The color of the new bottle is orange, while the color of my first bottle was pink.Has Bio Oil changed the verbiage of their packaging? The first bottle read \"Specialist moisturizer for\" and the new one read \"Helps improve the appearance of\"I trust my mom's choice of cosmetics, and if this new package is not authentic I won't use it. I ordered before I was out of the sample my mom gave me so I wouldn't miss a beat. It's been about a week since I tried to contact them, bottle sitting there unopened.

I suffer from adult acne and this helps to keep my skin clear and soft.  It's as if it has some kind of exfoliating properties to it.

It has \"bio\" in the name, has friendly script on the label, and even the touted ingredient, \"PurCellin oil\" sounds good, like \"pure\" and \"cells\", suggesting it's pure and doing something on the cellular level. Your basic feel-good marketing.To the good, yes, it's light, it spreads and absorbs somewhat easily.  It even smells very nice.  To the bad, it has done nothing for my slightly uneven skin tone, nor for dry skin patches on knees and ankles.  Maybe it does more for scars and stretch marks, but it didn't handle these \"easier\" issues well.  (To at least use the stuff up, I've been sweeping it on my lips before bed, and it has not done half as well in protecting and softening as the old DCT.)And Bio-Oil's first ingredient is -ooooh- \"Paraffinum Liquidum\".  Let's call a spade a spade - that's mineral oil!  You could get a bucket of mineral oil for less than this 2 oz. bottle.Fool me twice?  Not bloody likely.\n",

I have not destroyed any of my clothing yet but i have heard that people cant get out oil spots when they use this.

It kind of dries to where my clothes don't stick to my skin and i don't feel gross or anything. I used this in the winter so I can't say what it's like in summer when your skin is gross anyway from sweat. Great product for any condition which causes skin to stretch--including post surgical procedures. I used this daily for about two months on a moderate size area. Barely made a dent in the bottle. A smaller bottle would have been way more than I needed. Now I get to pass a mostly unused bottle on to my pregnant sister. Yay.\n",

It's embarrassing because it's right in the middle of my chest.Started using bio oil and noticed a difference within a couple of weeks. I've been using it for a month now and the scar is noticeably less red and not as raised. I tried massaging prior to this with tea tree oil and lavender but it did not work. Essential oils dried out my skin but bio oil keeps it moisturized. I use this right after I come out of the shower and right before bed time (it says to use twice a day).I also started using it on my face because I have some uneven skin tone and some old acne scars. It's cleared up my face and I swear my skin is brighter now. It's softer, too. I use it on my face same way, after a shower and at night. I've been doing this for a week and noticed a difference. My scar is more traumatic so I think it took longer to see a difference but this stuff works! 36 month shelf life and smells amazing too.

I have very sensitive skin and I haven't broken out because of this, although it does leave my face feeling a little oily during the day (but I just apply some makeup powder and it's not an issue).

Oh my God, it smells exactly like an old lady's perm!! I thought I would be able to ignore the scent & would get used to it, but instead, it just gets worse every time I use it. Needless to say, i will gifting the entire box of these soaps to anyone willing to take them - If anyone needs me, I will be in search of a liquid soap that doesn't make me want to wretch everytime I use it 😂\n",
            "The smell is awful, it smells faintly of nail polish remover. Even worse, the scent lingers for hours. The whole box is going into the trash. The order arrived quickly so I recommend the seller, just not this product.\n",
            "This is my favorite hand soap, it was sold out everywhere (along with all other soaps). I was price gouged heavily by paying 20 dollars for 6. In normal times this item sells for about 98 cents per bottle. Shame on Amazon. I still gave 5 stars because the soap itself is excellent.\n",
            "Dear Makers of Softsoap (and anyone considering buying),Thank you for creating a product named so aptly for how it works, and for how much it has helped me during the CoVid crisis. I have an immunosuppressed child, and always have been a hand washer, even before CoVid. In the early days of this event, I came to Amazon just seeking to buy bulk soap, and migrated to yours. As a classroom teacher, I used so much soap and always have been behind the curve, treating my chapped hands, rubbed raw from constant washing. I realized this morning as I again washed to my favorite 20 second tune, enjoying the light scent of my Softsoap pump, that my hands really are soft after washing, no chafing, just happy bubbles. The product washes off cleanly without residue...this is the perfect soap of our times. I’m sending sets to all of my first line friends and I thank you again for this product.For those considering buying, I give this the highest praise. Buy some for yourself and put it in a care package for someone it will bless.\n",
            "I love this handsoap. It is the only one I can use for my extremely sensitive skin. Used to buy these all the time - this EXACT item. It was a great deal - about $6.00 for 6 bottles.Why is it 3 times the amount now? Price gouging during a pandemic for hand soap is pretty disgusting.  What a shame, because this is a great soap.\n",
            "Had allergic reaction to this Softsoap, which says made in Canada. The formula is different from the original available at Costco. Thought I’d washed too many time yesterday, when my hands were red, with micro cuts at the end of day.  Testing today on rested skin and untouched skin resulted in Needle-like sensation, followed by red skin on both areas.Have not had such a bad reaction with Softsoap before.\n",
            "I bought these hand soaps for a shop I manage, but I ended up keeping one for myself because I love the scent!  It's a strong, clean scent that does linger on the skin, so if you're looking for something subtle this might not be the soap for you.  I personally adore it and will be purchasing more for myself.\n",
            "I know it's only hand soap, but I have adored this scent for years! Hard to describe, but it truly emulates what I consider a fresh, crisp, clean aroma. So airy and pleasant; not flowery, artificial or overpowering in any way.  If anything, 'Fresh Breeze' is a tad too subtle - that's how much I enjoy this fragrance! Had a difficult time finding it at our local brick-and-mortars, so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.  Another less obvious plus: factory packaged in a relatively thick, but compact box. Perfect for storing and tough enough to endure shipping sans damage / leakage - always a concern when purchasing online. (Can't count the number of compromised orders I've received due to poor packing. Are you listening, Amazon?) No worries here though. In short, thrilled with everything about this item!\n",
            "Absolutely perfect and every way.No allergic reaction for me.Easy to unpack and easy to use.I can put one and each bathroom and one in the kitchen sink then I have three backups.Very good item when you move into an apartment.Makes my hands silky soft. Doubles as body and face wash. Gentle on the skin; gets rid of oil buildup on skin. Item was not damaged in any way. They all came perfectly sealed and easy enough to open. Just twist the top, set it by the sink, done. Soap pump installed just like that. Absolutely perfect.\n",
            "Soap. This is soap. I guess that I like this soap. I do not have any issues with this soap. I have used Softsoap products for many years. It is of the liquid variety that I wanted and came in a 6 pack for about the same price as I would find in a store. The scent is not my preference but is fine considering that it is soap (I'm more of a vanilla fan myself). In the face of the pandemic, though, I will not scoff at  the scent of an essential product that quickly became hard to find (thanks, hoarders). It is not the worst scent that I have had from the Softsoap brand and the rest of it is exactly what I expected...soap. I have used it daily since I received it and have not, to my knowledge, been infected with any diseases...therefore, I would assume that it works? If you can get it, you will not have to go to the store for a while as it came in a package of 6 and that was the most important part for me.Therefore, I give this a rating of soap. I would say good soap. Now I implore you, as part of the human race, to use soap multiple times per day, especially after using a restroom (you know who you are so don't make this awkward for the rest of us). This one, in my humble and decidedly unprofessional opinion, works. Soap.\n",

This particular purchase was cheaper than going to the dollar store.  While this review is not for foam hand soap I will say my kids are getting their hands cleaner with this liquid soap because they have to suds it up themselves.  It’s a nice scent bath and kitchen.\n",

This particular soap Softsoap Liquid hand soap w/Alo Vera  not only cleans your hands but moisturizes them as well.Do NOT concern yourself that it doesn't say DISINFECT! IF you wash your hands properly warm water for at LEAST 20 SECONDS 2 verses of Happy Birthday, you are DISINFECTED & you aren't contributing to the advancement of DISINFECTANT resistant germs and viruses by putting DISINFECTANT soap into your ground water!\n",

If this was the only soap I ever had to use I probably wouldn't even need a moisturizer, but, unfortunately, the soap at my work is made from the acidic blood of angry demons.\n",

I really like this scent and certain. I transfer these soaps into my glass and electronic soap dispensers.If you found this review helpful to you , please vote below so I may improve my future reviews . Thanks.\n",
            "This is a great deal, my family always buys this brand Softsoap for handwash soap. I am not a fan of Foam soap so this one is perfect, I like that it doesn’t just sanitize my hands, it moisturize it too. I love to was mh my hands every 5 minutes when I cook, so now I have an ample supply, there was 6 in a box. It is very Perfect for my very dry handS in Winter.\n",
            "This soap dries my skin and smells like an ultra strong old man’s cologne. The only reason why I won’t be returning it is because Colgate-Palmolive (the manufacturer of SoftSoap) engages in draconian price gouging on all their other products during this pandemic.P.S Amazon, for the love of God, open your eyes on price gouging by this manufacturer, thanks.\n",
            "Good soap, decent price, doesn't fry yet still feels clean which a bug one on my part. Hubby likes a soap to feel smooth and not dry his hands out since he refuses to wear hand cream and washes his hands all the time. However I like the heavy duty soaps like mechanics and farmers use that strip everything from my hands. In all fairness I often have grease, oil, or manure from chickens cows and horses on me so I like to feel “squeaky” clean. Now if I am still extra dirty I will use my farmers soap but for normal use and if I just do the morning feeding chores I use this soap. It still feels clean without drying out my hands. The only con is that the last oz doesn't pump. Completely wasted. I try to save it by adding water or saving them up and combining them which takes forever since the soap is thick and does “run” into another bottle easily. So I would like to see the pump get atleast a bit more out of the bottom. As you can see in my pictures it is a decent amount left in the bottom. Now my son has seen me add water to the last bit and it has become a fun project if he slips away to the bathroom to play with the soap and sink while Mommy is distracted. So fun times for me 🙄\n",

The soap itself is nice and doesn't dry out my hands too badly like some other soap.  I was dressing some raw salmon today and this soap was able to wash away all the fishy smell. I'm pretty pleased with it.\n",

            "I’ve been using what I guess is the USA version for about two decades, specifically because it doesn’t dry out my hands, and I’ve never looked at the ingredients. When this shipment arrived, I compared it to my last bottle of what I’ve always used. It’s true: there are some slight differences, and if you happen to have a sensitivity to one of the very few ingredients that isn’t in your usual soap, you could have a reaction.What really took me by surprise was how many awful-sounding chemicals there are in the USA version! Fortunately, I don’t seem to have a sensitivity to either set of ingredients, and this version is just as soft and moisturizing as I’m used to. My only quibble is that this version does seem to have a very slight scent, but even so, it’s so mild that I’ve been able to ignore it.(It’s definitely not watered down. If anything, it’s a little thicker than what I’m used to.)\n",
            "The fresh scent Softsoap smells...good  At first I thought it was going to be too strong, but it hasn't been.  It works as well as all the other kinds of Softsoap that I've used.\n",
            "My only complaint about this product is that one of the soaps leaked during shipment (despite being in the locked position). It made a little bit of a mess as you can see from the pictures. However, I got a pretty good deal on these soaps (6 for $4.90), so I'm not that upset about it. Also, this is one of the only soaps that both cleans and moisturizes my hands pretty well. I have extremely dry skin, so I have to be careful of which products I'm using on my skin  otherwise I'll look like a scaled dragon. This is also my favorite scent. It's not too perfumey or strong; it's more subtle to me and light. Overall, I am definitely getting more of this soap, but probably not from Amazon unless I can get it at a steal again.\n",
            "First, this is a review on the product, so 5 stars for the fresh scent and lathering of the product.Zero stars for the shipping, as all 6 bottles had \"non-fixable\" dents in them. And they came packed in a small box, then inside a larger box, so I can't even blame the delivery man for the damage.  They were all beat up before they were packed into the larger box.Luckily, I will be transferring the product from it's original package to my decorative pump bottles.\n",
            "just look at my hands, i used it only for three days and cuts like scratches appeared on my hands DO NOT BUY THIS!\n",
            "This hand soap is awesome , it smells great , doesn't dry your hands out and how can anyone pass up 6 Hand Soaps for less than $6.00 ? They will last for a long time , not perishable. The Milk and Honey scented is a lovely scent , not too strong but a pleasant scent. These are full size at 7.5 oz with a pump. I really think this is one of the best deals I have seen in a while. If you see this and they are still at this low cost grab them before the cost of everything starts to rise sky high because it's going to ! This soap by the end of this year will be costing you I would guess around $12 -20 dollars.  It washes your hands well and you don't need to use antibacterial soap every time you wash your hands as you will become resistant to the effects. This will wash away any bacteria along with grease and grime while being gentle on your skin.\n",
            "They arrived damaged and spilled all over the place . Not impressed with the scent.\n",
            "Scent is nice, pretty pearl color and soap is moisturing. My go to soap during this pandemic! I wash my hands around 10-20 times a day with most being at 20 seconds, before and after I eat. I also made it a habit to wash my hands if I touch a common area. This is because I have roommates with children and it's flu/cold season. So you would think my hands would get pretty dry with all this washing but they're actually not and I'm not sick either! I also don't need to apply hand lotion as often as I would need with another soap brand.My only con is the condition of the products upon arrival. One of the bottles leaked and the other has a cracked spout so I would need to transfer them to another bottle that is safe to use. Other than that, it's the best bang for your buck!\n",

Seemed like a good deal Oh Boy. The smell. I though I could live with it. With my hands stinking like sickly sweet hand lotion smell. But I couldn't. Even thinking about that smell now makes me a bit gaggy. I used this soap for about 3 days. On or about the 3rd day I went to wash my hands and literally said \"Nope. Enough.\" I collected all six of them and threw them in the trash to prevent someone else using them and me accidentally getting this stink on my hands again. THEN, I went to Big Box Mart where they have Aloe hand soap, white creamy liquid, not slimy or sticky, and no strong odor, for 75 cents a bottle. Cheaper than this stuff.\n",
            "The soap is thick and lathers well, but the scent is too strong for me.  I mean wow.  I wasn't expecting that!  The price is good, but I can't use it because the smell bothers me so much.  I don't think there's anything wrong with the soap.  I just really hate the floral scent.  So if you have any sensitivities to perfumes, this is probably not a good soap for you.  On the other hand, if you really like floral scents, this soap provides that!\n",
            "I've been using Softsoap liquid hand soap for years.  But with the Rona, it has for a while been extremely difficult to get Softsoap in the stores.  When this became available, I jumped on it.  Overall, the soap itself is fine.  Get your hands wet, apply soap, lather and wash.  Much more sanitary than sharing a bar of soap.The biggest issue I had was with this particular Fresh Breeze scent.  It was not a mild scent, and more of an extremely strong perfume like scent.So if you can overcome the scent, it's a really good value.\n",
            "This Softsoap Aloe Vera has always been my favorite liquid soap, and still is. Unfortunately, all 6 pumps that I purchased in this case were defective. The tops would not open no matter how many times you twist them. These bottles say \"Made in Mexico\" on them, which is different from what I've bought in the past when they had \"US\" in the lot # instead of \"MX.\" So apparently the defective ones were made in Mexico while the ones that work fine are made in the USA. I am going to contact the manufacturer about this issue, and unfortunately I am hesitant to buy this 6-pack again because some other reviewers on here have mentioned having the same problem.\n",
            "Meh, it's soap. Probably helpful on the moisturizing front. Hopefully kills any covid on my hands. Kinda annoying that it has long strings of soap that don't want to let go of the pump when using, so that I end up with soap mess on the counter half the time. But whatever. It's soap, it helps me clean my hands, and my hands aren't dry and cracking from using dish soap like I was before.\n",
            "This is the only scent of hand soap that everyone in my family likes! Doesn’t dry out your hands too much in the winter.\n",
            "You can't go wrong with Softsoap!  I love that this comes in a 6 pack and has a ridiculously low price.  I have a bottle in each of our bathrooms and one in the kitchen.  Each bottle contains 7.5oz of Softsoap.  I chose the clean aloe vera scent as its my favorite.  It doesn't just wash/clean our hands, it moisturizes as well which is especially important now that its winter and our hands are dry and chapped.  These bottles will last quite some time and the price can't be beat.  I do think when its time to order more Softsoap I will go ahead and order this same item-6 bottles rather than the large refill bottle.  These bottles are perfect for home/office/restaurant bathrooms, kitchens.\n",
            "I love Soft Soap and have been using it for a few years now.  The aloe vera variety is one that makes me feel good and like I'm helping my  hands.  It refreshes my body and feels like I'm moisturizing.  When I got it, the price was pretty good.  Some sellers and different varieties  can be over priced.  Quite frankly, I have often been able to purchase Soft Soap for 99 cents a bottle from places like Safeway.  Buying online tends to be a more expensive proposition, so when I saw this group of 6 being offered for $5.94, I jumped on it, especially since it was available for subscribe and save which meant the cost was actually less.  I'll keep hoping to find some of my favorite other varieties offered at this same, reasonable price.  At any rate, I think it's a great product.\n",
            "I usually get the large bottles of soft soap from Costco to refill my soap dispensers but when I realized I was out and the Soap shortage hit us, I was lucky to find this deal. Though the scent is nice and light, seems more faint than normal and soft seems thinner and more watery than other soft soap I’ve used (even in this scent).

            "I bought this to replace an empty dispenser of presumably the same soap. However, the earlier version, which had the same labels and even the same SKU number,  dispensed foam; while this just dispenses a glop of soap gel. And in fact the short video included with the photos shows it dispensing foam.I called Colgate-Palmolive to ask about this, and was told that the formulation was changed in 2019 to a non-foaming formulation. In my opinion, this should be made clear in the description; and the video showing it dispensing foam should be removed or replaced, to avoid the false impression that this dispenses foam.\n",
            "While this is probably decent liquid soap it's not for me. The price is reasonable, it's pretty creamy is non drying on the hands. My biggest issue with it is the fragrance!! It's overwhelming not tolerable for me, admittedly I am sensitive to fragrance so I know there's many people that will enjoy the soap. For me it's bag to the drawing board. I can't technically recommend it.\n",
            "The pump tops don’t open. On any of them. Never had any issues opening a pump soap before but I’ll be damned if I could get even one of these to open. Ended up buying a pump soap holder and just pouring it in that one. The soap itself is fine but I bought pump bottles because I figured that was a done deal. Kind of annoying to them have to go order a separate pump simply bc these won’t work. I’d have just ordered a big refill if I’d wanted to do all that from the start. Will not purchase again.\n",
            "I have brought this soap for myself, sent some to my mother, and also to my daughter.  It is packaged well. The soap produces a nice lather and has a gentle scent. It leaves your hands feeling smooth. Normally I have to apply lotion after washing my hands, but not after using this aloe soap. Definitely worth the money. Shipped quickly.\n",
            "While having to wash my hands multiple times a day because of everything that's going on I found out that my hard and getting uncomfortably dry because of the many hand washes throughout the day with the soup I was using. Which results in having to using a moisturizer.This  solves this problem by combining the soup and the moisturizer together in one so now I'm not very worried about my hands getting dry and I am actually more motivated to wash my hands more often.  The package is very hand and has a bargain price in my opinion. I'm very happy with it.\n",
            "Good design!!! You apply pressure to the top,,and a \"squirt\" of liquid stones out the spout!!! Rubbing hands vigorously together creates a \"lather\" that will clean your hands!!! Its an ingenious idea,and I googled it and found the process is known as \"washing your hands\"  I recommend it\n",
            "I work in healthcare, so I have to wash my hands A LOT.  The soap we have at work is harsh- and I mean so harsh, my hands were so dry, raw, cracked, and bleeding. It was kind of a nightmare. So... I bring this Softsoap with me and use it at work. I also invested in some really good hand cream and use it several times a day. Now my hands are all healed!  They are no longer bleeding!  My hands no longer hurt. I don't have to stick a dozen bandaids all over my hands at work.\n",
            "I bought this soap during the covid-19 pandemic. So my choices were not that many, the scent even after  washing it off my hands still remainded on my hands.To the point if i rubbed my eyes they started to itch and burn. After using this soap less about Halfway Gone. It started to make my hands itch like crazy!!!! So I gave over 12 bottles to my sister to try. I told her what happened to me. And then said to my sister hope you have better luck. Needless to say I needed to repurchase a different soap.\n",

When I opened my Amazon package, everything was covered in liquid soap!One bottle in the Colgate-Palmolive box had the top completely unscrewed. What a mess.Now, after using the remaining bottles, I have discovered that EVERY SINGLE plunger dispenser is DEFECTIVE!!!  Not a single one will unscrewed to be able to pump soap.Obviously, Colgate-Palmolive sells its defective merchandise thru Amazon.BUYER BEWARE!\n",
            "I don't write that many reviews but when I find an item that I love I do. I absolutely love this product. It may seem silly to be so excited about simple hand soap but I was really pleased when I got it and I saw the quality was just the same as when I buy it in the store and the scent was so refreshing that I wash my hands way more than I normally do just so I have the smell on my hands! It rinses off easily and just leaves my hands smelling great and very soft. And the price can't be beat. I paid as much for one bottle of another brand as I did for 6 of the Softsoap. I haven't even used up one bottle yet and I'm already planning on buying more in case it gets sold out. The only con is that it is an add-on item but I don't ever have problems finding $25 of something else to buy so I can add the item but it would be nice if you could buy it without that but all in all I am very happy with this purchase and I recommend it to everyone!\n",
            "The soap is ok, but when I opened the box there was soap covering the outside of the bottles and the inside of box. Out of the 6 bottles, 5 did not have the tops screwed on all the way which caused them to leak in transit. Horrible mess, besides the fact that I paid for 6, but lost probably the equivalent of 1 full bottle. But the soap itself is ok, I just won't order again due to the leakage.\n",
            "Can't tell if like soap. Came from seller named Quality Photo with so much soap leaking out of the package it got everywhere include on fabric furniture. I don't know how I'm supposed to return it for the refund. Contacted seller, have heard nothing.\n",
            "Be aware that this is NOT the same as what you’ve purchased before. The list of ingredients on this page are WRONG. The manufacturer has changed the formula and added chemicals that aren’t listed. If you have sensitive skin like I do, this new soap may cause problems. I’ve used it for years and was so excited to finally find some. My hands broke out after only part of a day of using it, so I checked the ingredients. Shame on the manufacturer for not at least putting a “new” somewhere on the label.\n",
            "One of the bottles leaked inside/outside of the box, so the the other bottles were covered with the liquid from that soap.  Therefore, I had to wash the soap off of each bottle, which I should not have had to do.  The bottle that leaked was only half full when I received it. Also, as you can see from the picture, the pump on that bottle is broken, which means I will have to take the top off in order to use it, or wait until one of the other ones is empty and then use that top.  I realize this may not be a major issue, however the point is I should have received a full bottle with a pump that actually works, since that is what I paid for! Also the scent is very strong, definitely would not buy again.\n",
            "Like the headline says, this soap's pretty good, but it's got one major flaw. I'm not sure if it's how the bottle's shaped or something to do with the pump, but once you're nearing the end of the bottle, you're no longer able to get anything out with the pump. To be fair, usually that happens with most things when they're like, nearly empty, but I feel like it happens way too early here, and adding some water doesn't even help much...So yeah, the soap is nice, but the bottle/pump itself has an annoying flaw.\n",
            "It's way past the return/refund window, so just posting here to caution others - you may want to place these where leaking sticky soap liquid won't cause much damage. I ordered these months ago, and today when I went to reach for the last bottle, I realized that it's been sitting there leaking very slowly all this time (80% content gone). It must have been a very small crack, as the package showed no visible damage upon arrival.\n",
            "Have been using this hand soap for years and couldn't be more thankful that it's available on Amazon! Having sensitive skin can sometimes be a problem with these \"harsh\" hand soaps out there. Luckily, this soap allows me to wash my hands numerous times throughout the day without causing irritation or severe dry-out.Really like this soap and recommended to any who are considering.\n",
            "While the product is a good one, the packaging left a lot to be desired! I ordered this for my elderly mom. When she received them, some of the bottles had leaked. One was only about 1/2 full, as the rest had leaked out...all over the other bottles & box! My mom has a hard time standing for long & it was difficult for her to stand & rinse/wipe off the bottles. On top of that, she had a really difficult time opening the bottles & needed a friend to help her. I ordered this to make my mom's life easier, NOT more difficult! Amends should be made...\n"

I was eating a delicious dinner (tacos) and when I would take a bite, I can just smell a grandma's perfume. love grandma's, but come on. It was just overwhelming. I just can't use it anymore. I'm glad I didn't pay very much.\n",
            "The scent is my favorite for hand soap. The price is a great value also. One tip would be not to push all the way down when dispensing for a simple hand wash, helps save soap and stretch your money even further. I find a full pump is far too much soap for my needs.\n",

            "I really love the quality and foam of this soap. It's around a dollar per bottle, I am very happy with the price as Amazon is not price gauging unlike others. I love Amazon for that.My only problem was half bottles were leaky, dint loose much liquid soap tho. Happy with the soap, wish they dint came leaky and I dint had to order again also clean the bottles.\n",
            "The soap is really nice, and smells great.  The only problem I had was that one of the bottles had leaked resulting in a mess when I opened the package.  It had lost approximately half of its contents.  The value of this bottle was less than a dollar, so I didn't bother to return or ask for a refund.  I still recommend this product, but I'm not sure I will order it for delivery again.\n",
            "I love the scent of this hand soap.  It doesn't dry out my hands even with frequent hand washing during COVID.  My only complaint is the shape of the bottle.  There is always soap left at the bottom and you can't use the pump to get it out.  Seems life a waste.  Otherwise, I love this product.\n",
            "I ordered a 6 pack when they had these on a great sale. The fragrance isn't overwhelming, just the right amount of scent and it is perfect for sensitive skin. My daughter suffers from eczema on her hands and wrists and this hand soap doesn't irritate her skin at all. I will be purchasing this soap from now on instead of the B&BW soap we are accustomed to buying.\n",
            "I bought this soap and my hands broke out in rashes.  I used another soap, and my hands were fine.  I then tried this soap again, and I don't know, something in it, made my hands red and itchy.  And then I used this other soap, and my hands went back to amazing again.  I prefer to use soaps that don't have all these weird chemicals or dyes, because the soaps without chemicals or dyes seem to be very good to my hands.  I do not recommend this soap at all.\n",

I put 4 bottles in the bathrooms at work and gave the other 8 away. The scent is soooooo strong. My coworkers described it as a strong floral scent and an old lady scent. Do yourself a favor and smell this in person before buying.\n",

I couldn't get the smell off my hands even after multiple scrubbings and a shower. The pack of 6 wasn't much of a deal after all.I sent all of it to work with my husband - he works with guys, and I figured they would use anything - but I got a text from him later, saying, \"Can I throw the whole box in the dumpster?\"  It wasn't even worth the effort to return it. (We didn't want to put the mail carriers at risk, although we do feel a little guilty about the sanitation workers.) Seriously, Amazon, you should consider taking this product off your list.\n",

I usually try to color coordinate the soap color with the decor of each bathroom, but white works beautifully with any color. We like soft soap and it leaves our hands feeling clean and soft, not dry.\n",

Never knew what that felt like until using this. I couldn't even rub my eye without scratching my face because of how bad my hands had been. As soon as I stopped using this soap they were back to normal. Not moisturizong at all and hardly made any suds.\n",
            "Not only will some of your spouts arrive broken, but a finger or two of the soap at the bottom will be inaccessible (the tube doesn't reach). So either throw away some product you paid for, or unscrew the (probably broken) spout, turn it upside-down, and try to shake out the remaining soap. The experience of using this product is awful.\n",

Don’t get me wrong I’m glad I was able to get some soap during this pandemic but was expecting better quality.Color of the bottles are a little off, not as clear as a BRAND new bottle of soft soap.

Or did I receive a bad batch?\n",

The only thing is that the scent is not as honey sweet as I hoped it would be. But overall a great product at a great price!\n",

I haven't been through all of them yet, but all of the pumps have worked so far!I like the mild scent and gentleness of the soap.

I'll definitely purchase this again!!\n",

Perfect To keep on hand for every bathroom in the house, even the kitchen. Lasts a long time and smells great, not too overpowering. Couldn’t be more pleased! Thanks for the recommendation from my blogger friends!!! This is where have of my Amazon purchased come from.\n",

Plus, it's a great deal for the price. Quality product.\n",

I must say the third time around was a huge disappointment. This soap doesn’t bubble or “sud up” when you wash your hands. There is only a mild scent to this pack unlike the last two times. I have to wash my hands twice with this soap to feel like my hands are clean. Very disappointed. I hope someone can explain.\n",

Amazon was kind enough to replace it, but... it was a bit annoying to clean up.\n",

            "I love the Milk and Golden Honey fragrance of this soap it’s very subtle and soothing.Softsoap provides amazing lather and the value for the money makes it an easy choice.

            "The soap itself is decent, but the plastic bottle and the pump are not working. I tried all six of them.None  function. Don't waste you money! I am very angry with the company. I salvaged the soap by pouring itinto a glass bottle I had bought with a pump.\n"

Normally at the stores they are $1.99 a bottle !SInce Covid it has been difficult to purchase the gallon refills of any brand of soap.SoftSoap is a good brand and I have purchased it often. I use one in the kitchen and one inthe bathroom.Highly Recommend.\n",

I love that it moisturizes too and slippery enough to make sure you wash your hands longer.I just feel that buying in small quantities doesnt reduce our plastic use thus just giving 4 stars.\n",

I found this in a 6 pack and it was a great deal on amazon, about a dollar per bottle. My only regret is that I wish I ordered more at that price. This was my first time using this fragrance of soap and I fell in love with after using it the first time. I just don't understand how anyone could complain about this soap. It smells heavenly and it did not dry out my hands. I strongly recommend.\n",

Love the smell and how it doesn’t dry out my hands after using it.However the Amazon shipment came with 2 bottles busted and leaking soap all over the rest of the stuff in the box and then on my porch. Real nightmare to deal with, but Amazon immediately sent another 6pack expedited with no issues.Would 100% order this separate from the rest of your stuff.\n",
            "I love the fragrance and texture. It’s actually more economical than other soaps since it’s so rich.\n",
            "I haven't bought Softsoap for a long time.  I have always bought dial soap, but due to the current conditions with high demand and low supply I was willing to give this soap a chance.  Its a great soap and leaves hands clean and smooth.  Very pleased and will consider buying this in the future when it is available.\n"

            "Such a great deal! Lots of value for the money. Smells great too. I keep it in all the bathrooms and the kitchen. This is a better price than Walmart. I’ll definitely buy this pack again!\n",
            "Does just what it’s meant to! In a time where I’m washing my hands a million times a day this soap is moisturizing & does not dry them out as bad as other hand soaps do! It has a nice clean pleasant smell! A little goes a long way & has amazing lather! Highly recommend, a brand you can trust! Remember to WASH YOUR HANDS!!!\n",

WHEN I OPENED THE PACKAGE, I SAW THAT A COUPLE OF THE TOPS ON THE BOTTLES HAD COME OFF. ONE BOTTLE HAD LEAKED OUT COMPLETELY AND ANOTHER BOTTLE ONLY HAD ABOUT 1/2 OF THE PRODUCT IN IT.  IF I PAY FOR 12, I WANT 12, NOT 10 AND A HALF. THAT IS THE ONLY COMPLAINT I HAD ABOUT THIS PRODUCT.  - IT SMELLS AMAZING AND YOU CAN TELL THAT IT IS MOISTURIZING.\n",
            "Great scent... my favorite so far ...not overpowering, just clean and nice.. Getting six dispensers is very cool too, as these will last longer than a much more expensive soap dispenser that you buy somewhere else.\n",
            "Got it on a deal where its cheaper than anywhere. Good for the price I paid. Too thick so need more water to wipe it off. Smell lingers after handwash which sometimes feels uncomfortable. I am adding little water to dilute it down to avoid this issues.\n",
            "The picture shows pumps in these bottles but when they arrived there were no pumps so I have to pour them into older bottles to be able to pump instead of picking the whole thing up and pouring into our hands.\n",

All six of the bottles I purchased are incapable of being opened normally, regardless of number of attempts made.Slamming the tops against a counter did eventually work to resolve the matter, suggesting that the issue may be because the plastic of the pump and lid isn't properly separated from one another. Following getting the pump working, the soap initially comes out irregular- sometimes overly liquidy, sometimes overly thick, sometimes overly oily, sometimes overly scented.. but shaking vigorously and then letting the soap settle appears to work to get the soap back to the expected consistency and traits.However, even after resolving initial annoyances, there are still some additional ones: Soap comes out around pump, and the lid keeps coming loose (an annoyance which made the initial attempts at opening the pump up all the more troublesome).I've exclusively used softsoap products for hand soap for the past decade, and I've no intention to switch to a different brand for the time being. I find the quality of the soap in the refill containers I typically buy to be great quality for the cost (cucumber melon, coconut & warm ginger, and fresh breeze are my go-toes, for those looking for recommendations). In the future, however, I'll either be purchasing my dispensers in-store, or from different brands- even at the cheap price you can get these at, they're just not a good deal (relative to purchasing better dispensers and softsoap refills separately).\n",
            "I bought this soap for work, and was sitting at my desk wondering, what is that smell?  Is it me, or is it the office?  I finally realized at the end of the day that it was the scent of the soap lingering on my hands.  It's a strong, long-lasting scent that I personally really like.  I don't think it smells like a perm!  It's more like a nice, fresh, gender-neutral cologne.\n",
            "We bought these for our daughter because she was going through my bath and bodyworks soap like water. Needed something that has a nice smell so I can tell if she skips a wash but something not too expensive because of the amount of soap she uses a day. I also needed something in a plastic bottle just incase she drops it, this has worked out quite well.\n",
            "All that  needs to be said, do your research and live free from SLS!\n",
            "I've of course tried other scents from Softsoap. I decided to try the milk and honey one this time and we all really like it. The smell is not overwhelming, which is very important to me, but it does leave behind just the right amount of smell. My hands feel soft, so I will probably get this scent again.\n"

            "I generally find Soft Soap to be the go to when it comes to buying hand soap because every store has it and it gets the job done with no problems. What I expected was some hand soap that was of the usual Soft Soap consistency that would leave my hand feeling clean when I washed it. However, whatever fragrance they used to scent this product is extremely overpowering, I had to buy Dial hand soap to use when I plan on touching my face or upper body with my hands. I've actually had house guests comment on how potent the fragrance from this hand soap is! The bottle does have a tendency to leak after you use it for the first time (the soap coats the pump on the outside and transfers when you move it). As far as hand soaps go, this is not drying and harsh like other hospital-grade soaps I'm accustomed to using. I'm disappointed that I have a few more bottles to use and I don't want to use them. I know better than to make the mistake of purchasing this again in the future.\n",
            "We use lots of hand soap in our house.  Between sports and gardening and manual labor work, we collectively wash our hands 30+ times a day. That was drying my hands out severely.We bought lots of different brands and soaps to try out (antibacterial, not antibacterial, scented, not scented) and this one was our favorite. The scent is there but light enough to not be overwhelming on your skin post-wash. The bottle is a great size to have at each sink. The price for the 6 pack was amazing. And while it is not as moisturizing as B&BW soaps, the lower price tag was worth the trade off. Next time I will buy the big refill bottle and save even more more money. Highly recommend.Note: Like many people, I rely heavily on Amazon reviews before making almost any purchase, online or in brick-and-mortar stores. I am always honest with my reviews. If I love something, I shout it from the rooftops. And if I hate it, I have no problem telling you that too. If you found this review helpful, please click the button below :-)\n",
            "One of the bottles was not sealed correctly somewhere in sealing and packing  This caused a spill in the package and loss of a portion of the soap in one bottle. The box inside was soaked and all the other bottles I had to rinse off.  I believe the lid was cracked at some point. That bottle should be replaced.Other than this, I’ve purchased this soap previously and love to use it.\n",
            "I've noticed there are a lot of reviews where people are saying the smell is horrible.  The smell is not horrible.  It smells a little like a shampoo we've all used at one time or another.  It's a little intense, but all you have to do is rinse your hands an extra 15 seconds and 90+% of the smell is dissipated.Not to mention the price is great.  I bought this, at first, because I was having a hard time finding the Dial Anti-bacterial soap I normally use.  But if you research it, most experts say you're better off with non anti-bacterial soap anyway.  If you wash your hands thoroughly, you remove germs anyway.Like I said, you can't beat the price, so if this comes back again, I highly recommend picking up a 6 pack.\n",
            "I have bought Softsoap before, but something seems off with these - they are much more runny, almost like they have been watered down. We have been through  a couple of the bottles we bought and others in my family noticed as well. We compared to another bottle we bought from the store and there is a clear difference. We are flying through this soap because of this, it just doesn't go as far as usual. The soap smells fine and seems to do the job but just doesn't seem like what we are used to from Softsoap. Will still buy Softsoap, but will get from the store from now on.\n",
            "I am getting this now, because my kids love hand soap instead of soap bar. This is great for them when are out playing on the dirt, so you get them to clean their hands right away. With the soap bar is a headache, they don't like it that ouch. I like more the bar soap, because you don't get the extra moisture on your hands, this soap leave that sensation on your hands. It is a matter of preference, but really good product.\n",
            "Will be contacting Amazon for a return. Purchased a 6 pack and all six bottles have a brownish hue at the bottom of the bottle and the top by the cap. Not sure if these are old product, not the correct liquid inside, or something else. The scent is fine, but not comfortable using based on the coloring (should be clear bottle with blueish liquid soap). Very disappointed as I waited over a month to receive.\n",

            "Bought this after running low on hand soap and being unable to find it in stores recently. Absolutely love the scent compared to most generic scents and have gotten compliments on it with people asking \"I really like your new cologne.\" A small pump will lather quickly and provide more than enough coverage. Is very gentle and leaves my hands feeling great though I should note it is not moisturizing so with frequent hand washing throughout the day either purchase a soap with moisturizer or be sure to use a moisturizing cream to prevent dry, irritated skin that comes with repeated hand washing.\n",
            "I've tried several brands of hand soap and all in all, they all seem to work pretty well for cleaning your hands.  I like to have one at each sink.  Some brands I have tried are a lot more expensive than Softsoap, but I prefer this brand.  Strangely enough, what makes this brand stand out to me is the dispenser mechanism.  It works really well.  It smells good, although I am not too fussy about that.  The price is great.  And having 6 on hand ensures I won't run out.\n",
            "I am very sensitive with scents for soap, and this is one I have always been able to tolerate, so I was happy when it came back in stock. The item came as described, and quickly. They were packaged nicely, however 1 of the 6 twisted open and was leaking a little bit, but I was able to just wash it off and it was fine. Would defintely purchase again!!\n",
            "This is the type of soap I like but it’s definitely the smaller bottles unlike what I ordered last time. Pay attention to oz. Every single bottle was completely banged up even though they came in a small box inside of another box with other things, both boxes and all other items were in perfect condition which tells me that this is not a shipping issue but how they were sent to me from the seller. Did I get someone else’s return? Highly Disappointed in quality control and I will not buy again.\n",
            "Now I absolutely see why other reviewers were complaining about the smell. I have used Softsoap for years and never had a problem. This scent smelled old. Probably had been forgotten in some warehouse and they were trying to get rid of this particular batch. The bottle was even yellowed around the top. It does lather and clean like intended, just has an extra strong odor. Won’t be ordering this scent again, even at an amazing price.\n",
            "I love this soap. It doesn't dry out your hands like most hand soap does. That's extremely important with all the handwashing we need to do right now. I highly recommend this particular type of SoftSoap as being kind to your skin. This purchase was for 6 bottles of the soap at a price that was very reasonable. No price gouging like so many sellers are doing at this time. I will definitely buy again. I love the soap.\n",
            "You can get these cheaper elsewhere but I subscribe to them for the convenience of just having them all the time. This is a soft scent it doesn’t overwhelm you or leave an odor in the bathroom after you have washed your hands.The packaging has never leaked during shipping and that Is a miracle considering I now see how my packages get beaten up.\n",
            "This scent is not the best of the Softsoap scents. Smells a bit off compared to the other fragrances. I had an issue with how they packed their own soap which I believe is somewhat careless. There us no divers or cushion of any sort to protect their own product. The box arrived full of spilled soap inside. It has seemed if the bottles were just thrown in or had gotten shook around too much which was enough to loosen the lids of two if the soap containers leaving a stained box and a mess for me to clean. There was no point in sending it back since I am afraid it be trashed anyway and I had gotten it on sale. I tighten the lids and handwashed all the bottles and sat them there to dry in the bathroom for a day. What a waste of product!\n",
            "The scent is Fresh Breeze by Softsoap which comes in 7.5 oz bottles in a 6-pack. If you are sensitive to scent, this is strong enough for me to smell while washing through my mask but if you wash the correct amount of time needed for handwashing the smell is no longer on your hands. It both cleans and softens my hands while sanitizing. You don't need a lot to wash your hands clean.\n",
            "The biggest difference between branded soap like this and cheaper store brands is the strength of the scent. Store branded scents fade out so fast that your hands barely smell clean was you wipe them dry. This could be great for those that are sensitive to fragrances and stuff. But branded soap does have a stronger, nicer scent to them that doesn't immediately fade away. I prefer that. So when they go on sale I try to load up so this soap has been good for me.\n"

It is not antibacterial but it gets our hands clean without drying them out. The price was about $5.00 for six which is good. I have seen these in dollar stores for a buck a piece but this was even cheaper. In general I use big refills and fill my bathroom soap dispenser but I needed hand soap for the kitchen and our camper and these were perfect for those areas. I have no complaints.\n",
            "Great smelling soap. One annoyance is that the plastic pump straw is too short. This prevents you from be able to pump the bottle empty so there is always an amount in the bottom of the bottle that you cannot get too unless you refill it. It it were not for the packaging defect I would have given it a perfect score because I do like the soap a lot.\n",

I do not pick up on any scent. The handsoaps I received seem to be legit in every  way. I am very happy with my purchase.\n",

I believe that because of this that's why the scent doesn't stay on my hands. If I had to choose scented film on my hands or a clean rinse & no scent, I'll take the clean rinse.\n",

I'm the person that always cuts my Softsoap and the thick soap that comes from BBWorks with purified water because it's so THICK and I want it to stretch longer. With THIS, I don't have to do that. I bought 12 bottles.\n",

I figured I'd order anyway because I'd only be out a few bucks if it went awry, but sure enough, it was the real deal! Very happy purchaser here!\n",
            "I LOVE this soap, but like others struggle to find it in stores. So I was excited when I found a 6 pack for $5! Now I can stock up of my favorite soap. 6 out of 6 bottles were received perfect, no spills or opened bottles.\n",
            "It took a while to get here due to the currently state of the world. I ordered 2 boxes for that particular reason. I had to share with my adult children to keep them from taking it from my bathroom and kitchen sinks. I’m glad I ordered so many at once, will order again before I run out.\n",
            "We have one in each bathroom and in the kitchen. We are a family of 6 and it lasts us about 2 weeks but since I'm dropping some off to my sister is with child it may be a little less. It's a great value especially now with all that is going on in the world.  I feel like this doesn't dry my hands as much as other products.\n"

            "Again, I received what may be a \"second\" and not a first line quality item from the initial seller. Ultimately, only 1 out of 6  push-pump dispensers worked. I tried the first dispenser and turned it about 30 times but to no avail, and yes, I was turning it in the correct direction... lol. [My husband actually asked...lol]  Okay... when tens of thousands of bottles are likely sold, there can be failures and glitches. BUT, I then tried to open a push-pump dispenser to another Softsoap for the kitchen, and then  2 others for the bathrooms. They would not pop up - at all - despite 20 to 30 turns, whereas it normally takes less than five. So, I tried the remaining. Out of the 6 Softsoap bottles, only 1 worked--  and that was only after a ridiculous number of turns. The entire batch has bad push-pump dispensers.  Epic fail. This is more than simply a rare glitch. It's evidence of a bad production run of dispensers.  It also appears that the box had previously been opened and re-taped -- which is  always a warning sign or red flag. [Were these also  returned, then mistakenly re-shelved, then sold again?] I was both pleased and surprised at the price point. Were there so cheap because they are seconds?  I will be returning.\n",

            "Nice smelling hand soap and very inexpensive.  However, it's annoying when the bottle doesn't empty towards the end.  The pump hose is too short and doesn't go all the way to the bottom of the bottle, therefore leaving about 1/2 inch of soap that won't pump out. Hence the reason for only 3 stars.  I usually just add water, take out the pump and use the remainder in the shower to use it all up.\n",

Frequent use makes me need to up my hand location use but I think it does the job you buy it for.It arrived in its own little soft soap six pack box, unopened, inside of another Amazon box.

            "You ever washed and felt dirty? Look no more this thing will have your scrubbing the clean off, thinking it's soap! I never felt so smoothe and squeaky clean in my life, probably when I was a baby. Now I utterly understand the saying \"as clean as a babies bum\". I've tried this product before, and absolutely love it. Literally just got out the shower, I still feel like I got soap on me and I'm dryer than can be, but moisturized! I'll give it a 10 and a super thumbs up!Ps: No I'm not exaggerating, I really feel this clean. :D\n",

I also used a stretch mark oil as well so I'm not sure if it was that or this soap but I only got one small stretch mark. I continue to use it in the winter though. No itchy skin on my back! It also smells great. The moisturizer is a bit overkill in the summer months so I switch to a lighter wash.\n",

            "My skin is really needing some moisturizing these days, and I just started using this Dove Purely Pampering Coconut Butter body wash.  First off, the scent is nice.  You do get the smell of coconut and then start smelling a slight floral scent mixed in.  I wish it was just plain old coconut, which seems hard to find these days.  Everyone has to layer scents now, but sometimes I like just a good old fashioned pure scent, like plain coconut, plain lavender, and so on. But it's an okay enough scent.  It suds up to a very nice, rich, luxurious lather which is wonderful.  It feels very pampering, in deed, as its description mentions.  And then I did feel like my skin was nicer afterward, as if I had used some body lotion.  I am really happy with it and plan to continue to use it.\n",
            "I tried this body wash because I love the scent of coconut butter and thought it would be interesting to try it with cocoa butter as the second main scent. I wasn't a huge fan of the smell but once I got into the shower and lathered up I loved the way it made my skin feel. It was smooth and silky and no need to apply lotion after showering which is a time saver. Dove does a great job making products that are dermatologist recommended and pH-balanced. I also like that the bottle is made from 100% recycled plastic!\n",
            "I love Dove products. They have the most moisturizing non-irritating soaps and this coconut butter wash is an amazing addition to the products I already adore by them. I love the scent— it has that wonderful coconut smell, but it isn’t overwhelming or perfumery. It’s incredibly moisturizing— and made my skin feel really soft right out of the shower. I also like how this suds up— its very rich and creamy. This will definitely be a go to this spring-summer because the scent reminds me of beaches and swimming. I absolutely adore!\n",
            "I usually buy a different name brand but decided to try this one out.My daughter loves Dove products, so I thought we would give her brand a try.This product had an amazing scent!It left my skin soft and moisturized all day with no tight feeling.It didn't leave a residue on my skin either that some body soaps can do.Will definitely be switching to this brand!\n"

The body wash is a peach like color and lathers very well. It cleans really well and rinses off very well as well. It makes my skin feel more soft and less dry than my other body washes, so that is a plus.  Everyone in my family like it and use it.\n",

            "So, it's important for me to point out that I'm a guy who tends to embrace more \"manly\" brands when it comes to body wash and deodorant.For years I have been using Axe Body Wash and I have been quite happy with the way it performs.I was offered the opportunity to try Dove Pampering Body Wash and I agreed to try it, thinking it would be a product suited for women.I took my first shower this morning using Dove instead of Axe.  The first thing I noticed was the creamy consistency of the Dove soap compared to the Axe gel.  Though the Dove did a nice job of lathering across my body, it wasn't as abundant as the Axe.I can tell you that the feel of this product against the skin is completely different than what I normally experience.  There definitely seems to be a much less gritty clean with the Dove brand.  It's much gentler.  I am sitting here right now rubbing my fingers and hands together and they feel very soft.  So, the claims of this being a moisturizing product is completely true.And while there is a hint of Coconut scent in the soap, the scent is far less evident in the skin afterward than the Axe.  Axe has a longer-lasting after scent compared to the Dove, but for some people, that may be a huge plus.I am really impressed with Dove.  It's definitely something I would want to use during the winter months when my skin is really dry.I give this a very high recommendation for men.  I would imagine women already know how great this product is.\n",
            "We use Jason brand body wash in this household and are quite happy with that product with the exception of the Coconut flavored body wash from that company because it has an odd smell and texture.The only reason for choosing this Dove product is that it is advertised as Coconut Butter (& cocoa butter) based.  The label itself prominently displays a coconut to reinforce this perception.  Based on the name and the label picture, This is appealing because coconut butter makes a great lotion ingredient and we Love the artificial coconut smell that commercial coconut products typically smell of.I am disappointed to report that this product does Not smell like artificial coconut but is highly perfumed.  In fact it is really heavily scented such that it is actually unpleasant.Apart from the bad smell, this product does work well and feels like an emollient when used and is expecially good for use with a wash cloth as it has a lot of body than the Jason product.  As to its moisturizing properties, it is difficult to say whether it actually does pamper and soften skin but it certainly does not dry it out or irritate it in any noticeable way.One thing that should be changed is the dispensing cap which has a hole that is over large and results in a large gob of goo whenever it dispenses material.  This results in a lot of waste product that gets washed down the drain.Finally, magnification is required to read the list of ingredients and reading it reveals that there is hardly any cocoa or coconut product in it.  In fact, there is more perfume or fragrance in this stuff than either of cocoa or coconut butter.  In the order of things, Fragrance appears on line number Five while the Cocoa and Coconut ingredients are found on lines Six and Seven.Finally, the color of this stuff in not appealing.  It looks a bit like putty or something and it should be either pure white or something eye-catching, perhaps the color of coconut shell.  As it is, it just looks blah and unappealing.To sum up.  This stuff works well, expecially with a wash cloth.  It's smell is over powering and unpleasant; It contains very little actual cocoa or coconut butter; The color needs a makeover; The dispensing cap produces a wasteful amount of product that gets wasted.If these issues are addressed, this product should be very well received by the public.\n",
            "This Dove Purely pampering body wash is awesome! Not only is it sulfate free, something that is very important to me, but it is also effective! It certainly helped to moisturize my dry skin. I usually have to use a lotion after showering to combat itchy, dry skin. However, after using this moisturizing wash with coconut butter and cocoa butter, I did not have to do that. My skin felt clean, moisturized, soft, smooth, and it didn’t itch.I needed only a small amount of this rich wash to make a nice, rich lather. The scent smells like cocoa butter and is pleasant. The scent lingers on the skin after showering. This wash is also recommended by dermatologists for effective skin care. It is filled with gentle and effective skin care ingredients. I love this wash!Even the price is great! This deal is for four full-sized, twenty-two-ounce bottles. The flip top is added convenience.\n",
            "With COVID-19 this is such a perfect product. I shower and handwash more than normal (which is a lot).  There is still no hand soap for sale in my area, so I decided to spoil myself a little and get some Dove Body Wash to use as body wash and to refill my hand soap containers.  All I can say is \"WOW,\" I forgot how wonderful Dove soaps are!!!  I grew up on bar Dove soap, but haven't used it in 20 years.  This Dove Purely Pampering Body Wash has made my hands silky smooth and soft, with no need for lotion (when used as a hand soap).  As a body wash, it's pure luxury.  My skin feels smooth, soft and silky. I also use it to shave my legs and it works well. It feels healing on my sensitive skin, which is a relief during these warm and humid days. My 5 YO daughter keeps asking to use it, too. And, it smells great--especially if you love coconut. It's not the classic Dove scent I remember, but it's nicely scented. I doubt I'll ever go back to buying regular hand soaps (including the mall brand soap) to refill my dispensers--I love this too much :-)I hope you found this review helpful!  Stay safe and healthy!!!\n",
            "I noted in my recent review of another brand bodywash that the 22 fl. Oz. bottle is quite large and does not fit that well in one’s palm. Not so with this Dove of identical quantity. Its bottle is slimmer (but slightly deeper); not likely to slip out of my hand.I love Dove brand and have purchased its products over the years. This bodywash says “new” on the bottle, and also “restoring”, with cocoa butter and coconut butter as principal ingredients. The liquid is rich and pinkish, perhaps taking on the color of cocoa. It has pleasant smell though not highly fragranced, and it lathers little. (I had to read the bottle in the shower to make sure I was not using a moisturizer). I stepped out of the shower feeling nourished, though I missed lather.\n",
            "I tend to have dry skin so I look for body washes that won't leave my skin feeling dry. This body was is perfect for my needs. First of all, I love its scent! Has a strong coconut and something else, maybe it's the cocoa. And I just need a small amount on my mesh sponge to wash my entire body. While rinsing off, my hands glide easily on my skin.And after I dry off, my skin feels smooth and moisturized. I actually can get away with not having to apply an additional moisturizing lotion at this time of the year. I still have to see how well things go during the cold winter months when my skin gets extra dry.Even with my eyeglasses on, it's difficult to read the ingredients listed on the bottle. But at the same time, I'd have to google most of the ingredients to even begin to understand what they are and what purpose they serve. But knowing that Dove does not test on animals is always good to know.\n"

My skin is restored.Why does being trapped at home slowly regress your formerly civilized self into it's primordial origins?That is, if our ancestors had Prime Video & pizza delivery.My daily routine of shower & moisturizing has, well.. declined and,my skin is paying the price.After one use of Dove's Restoring wash and the pain of neglect is gone.It's so rich, like lotion and suds like a thousand bubbles.Doesn't bubble so well in a bubble bath but on a scrubbie, amazing.Only note I would suggest, is maybe transfer into an old pump bottle.The hole really is too large for the amount of product you need.And who really can gracefully grab a wet 22 oz bottle of body wash and,not have it slip & take out a toe?Smells so good with a light coconut hint,makes you want to pull away from your Gilmore Girls marathon & take a shower.\n",

            "06/May/2020PROS✔️ Pleasant scent, very creamy and tropical.✔️ Creamy texture, lathers well.✔️ Moisturizes really good!CONS- Maybe I am too used to '100% natural' alternatives now, I don't like to see chemicals in the labels of my soaps. But hey, I knew that beforehand, so this is no reason to remove starts from this product.Very good!I am giving this a 5/5 recommendation!* I will update this review if something changes as I keep using the product.* If you found this review helpful, please click below! This will help other users like you to make informed decisions before spending their money!\n",
            "Since I typically have dry skin in the winter, I liked that this product actually did make my skin feel less like a snake and more smooth and youthful looking.  It lathers up well in the shower and felt like it glided over my skin well too.  The scent is an added bonus.  It isn't too strong or overpowering.I don't feel like it's leaving a residue on me or see any weird residue in my shower either, so it rinses clean.Overall, recommend for those with dry skin.  As for price, the price at the time I wrote this review was in line with what you'd pay at a retail store per bottle.\n",
            "I have super sensitive skin, skin allergies, and eczema. My allergist and dermatologist both suggested using Dove body wash, which was a surprise to me... I was expecting them to say another brand. Dove is silky smooth and offers a nice protective barrier on my skin that helps prevent the rashes and heat sensitivity that I get from all of the allergens and the basic harshness of my day-to-day. Also, a huge benefit, this absolutely smells wonderful. I never thought I could use something scented again, but I love the smell of coconut.\n",
            "I'm not a fan of having shelves full of products when one or two will do. I've never used body wash... and you know why? Dove soap makes a great shower soap! It lathers and is gentle and moisturizing. I gave this body wash I try anyway. It's okay, but no improvement over the soap. It doesn't lather very well and the coconut scent is kind of funky. I love coconut-scented products... my go-to conditioner is the tube of Color Treat that comes with Natural Instincts hair color. Now there's a beachy scent I really love. So, if I'm out of soap, I'll put this in the shower line-up. Otherwise it's nothing that I really need.\n",
            "The  Coconut and Cocoa Butter smells great and lathers well but not overly so. It cleans my skin and doesn't dry it out. I tend to use fancier body washes from specialized body products websites and stores but honestly, Dove works as well as the pricey ones. It is affordable and does the job mildly. I am happy with this product and I especially love the scent which takes me to the beach - in my mind at least.\n",
            "I have used dove products for awhile now, and this is another great product from dove. I like the original scent of dove, so this scent was different and a change for me, but it smells pretty good. It has a shear butter smell to it, but also a coconut or sweet smell as well so it is a pleasant scent. It leaves your skin feeling soft and moisturized as well as smooth.  I use this with a lufa daily and it keeps my skin soft.\n",
            "Oh my gosh is all I can say.  What a delightful fragrance and moisturizing body wash.  I like the thick textured formula as it doesn't run off my sponge like some other brands.  The yummy fragrance reminds me of macaroon cookies/candy.  It's one of my all time faves and I'll definitely keep this one in stock!\n",
            "This dove coconut butter body wash smells so good and gives me a fresh clean feeling all day. It has a thick consistency. It is quick to lather and goes on very smoothly. My skin feels soft and smooth after showering. I like and I would highly recommend this.\n",

            "This really is excellent soap.  I was a soapscriber for a while but have canceled my subscription.  Not because I didn't love the products - they were fantastic!  But I'm now making my own soap, inspired by Dr. Squatch.  I ordered this Pine Tar soap from Amazon so I could test it (from Amazon instead of direct from Squatch) and write a verified review. There are some negative reviews for this and I'll address those points here.First, this is COLD PROCESS soap!  You 100% cannot treat this like the soap you buy at the store, it's totally different.  This soap is going to be much softer and you need to keep it out of the water as much as possible.  If you leave this somewhere where water is constantly hitting it, it's going to melt away and you are going to be a sad panda.  This is not unique to Dr. Squatch soap, it's something that most any cold process soap will do.  Keep the soap high, dry and happy folks.The scent of the pine tar soap from Amazon was really strong when I opened the package.  It does have a Pine Sol smell to it.  Out of the Amazon packaging this dissipates a lot.  The scent of the soap does not really stay on my skin like the other soaps Squatch produces.  This is probably because there is little to no essential oil or fragrance oil in the soap.  The list of ingredients is different on the website and my packaging.  On the soap I received there were no essential or fragrance oils listed, that's not the case on the website.  The other soaps I have used from Squatch definitely leave a scent on me for the next 3-4 hours, this was not the case with this bar of Pine Tar soap.  This is probably because there are no essential/fragrance oils and the amount of pine tar in the soap is really minimal.  You may or may not like the smell, just know that out of the Amazon box it's going to be much stronger than normal.The Pine Tar soap has sand and oatmeal in it for exfoliation.  I read a review here that said there are wood chips.  That's insane.  Oatmeal and sand.  I didn't find those harsh at all.  I don't have any skin conditions but the soap has my skin smooth and soft.With all Squatch soap, I use fishing line to cut each bar into 4 pieces before I use it.  I find that the scent fades after about a week of use.  This has been the case with all of the soaps I have used from Squatch.  I suspect it's just water absorbing into the soap and bringing the oils closer to the surface.  As this repeats, more and more oils are drawn to the surface of the soap and when you get below a certain point there are no more.  Cutting the bars up prevents me from using unscented soap for weeks on end as 1/4 of a bar of soap will last me almost 2 weeks.When I shower, I use a brush and lather that up with my soap chunk (a brush like this one: MAGGIFT Removable Natural Boar Bristle Long Handle Body Brush For Dry Skin Brushing, Remove Dead Skin And Toxins, Scrub And Exfoliation Shower Brush Massage Scrubber. Dry Skin Body Brush, 16 inch).I keep the soap out of the stream of water at all times.  After I've lathered up the brush several times (and all of me) I take the soap chunk and lather up again using the soap on my skin instead of the brush.  When I'm finished showering I put the soap on a rubber coated wire shower caddy that sits behind my shower heads.  It is completely and totally out of any streams of water.  With this particular chunk of soap I was able to get 13 showers (out of 1/4 of the bar).  So the entire bar would make it to 50 showers for me.  I create a lot of later and basically lather myself twice each time I shower.  I don't use the soap lightly at all!A few more points.  This soap has a very small amount of pine tar in it.  There are soap recipes that have up to 20% pine tar in the soap.  The amount in this soap is nowhere near that, it's for sure less than 5% of the soap based on the list of ingredients and probably 1-2%.  If you are trying to clear up a skin condition you might shop elsewhere or look into making your own.  The ingredients on my box do not match the website.  Either something is inaccurate or the formula has changed.  I suspect that if the formula has changed to what is listed on the website now, the scent of the soap would last outside the shower.  Keep in mind that soap is a wash off product and it's not going to get you smelling the same as if you douse yourself in Axe spray or something.  If you want to smell like the forest all day, maybe grab some cedar essential oil.The pictures I attached to this review...the first one is out of the box.  The second one is after 7 showers and the final one is after 11 showers.  I got 13 showers out the the chunk.  By the end their was scent left in the chunk but it was not as strong as it was at first.  I'll repeat, I kept the chunk of soap out of the stream of water AT ALL TIMES.  Do not buy this or any cold process soap if you're going to just keep it where water is always hitting it.  You'd be better off just taking your money ($10 in this case) and setting it on fire.  Keep the soap out of the water.To summarize, this is excellent soap!  Keep it out of the steam of water and it's going to last you a while.  You may or may not like the smell.  If you're unsure, smell some diluted Pine Sol...that's pretty close.  There isn't much actual pine tar in the soap, so if you're looking to alleviate a skin condition you might want to look into another brand that has more pine tar in it.  I've been very happy with all of Dr. Squatch's soaps.  Before I tried them showering was kind of whatever - just something I did.  But since I've used Squatch soaps I actually look forward to showering, it's very enjoyable.  I love the difference it's made with how my skin feels and my wife really likes the scents.  IF you treat the soap right, it will last.  To me, it's a no brainer - definitely worth a little extra cost for a high quality soap!\n",
            "I bought two bars of this  nautical sage soap.  I purchased one about two months ago and one last week.  The first bar I bought looked like it had spices and all kinds of ingredients in a tan color bar. The second bar which smelled nothing like the first one was almost white in color. It looks like they’re cutting corners trying to make a mass production version. The second bar smelled like dove with chemical  ingredients kind of like the first bar that I bought. The second bar was enough to send me over the edge in never wanting to buy this product again. It’s sad that this company that seemed to grab everyone’s attention is  trying to do the same Garbage all the other big soap companies are doing.\n",
            "I bought this after reading so many great reviews on this soap.  I'll admit I was slightly skeptical that some reviews mentioned it lasted longer.  I take one shower a day and it is gone in about two weeks.  I do like the smell but can't say I'm blown away as some reviews also mention.  Lastly, on a positive note, I do like the exfoliating grains of sand in the soap that help to exfoliate...one of my favorite features.Overall, I should have gone with my gut, but I was willing to give it a try.  Maybe I'll try another scent however at almost $10 per bar it's hard to justify for anyone on a modest budget.\n",
            "I...gotta...tellya...I'm really disappointed.  I was excited to try this soap as it had so many great reviews.  I read a lot of them and they all said the stuff was great.  Smelled good, worked good, and the manufacturer has great service.  HOWEVER, the reviews about it not lasting are absolutely true.  I paid $10 for a bar of this stuff off here and when it came in, I verified that it smells great, does a great job cleaning, and leaves your skin feeling clean and smooth.  But, to my sadness (I really love this soap), this bar of soap does not last long at all.  Certainly not \"$10 for a single bar\" long.  The size of the bar is about the thickness of two iPhones stacked on top of each other and about as big as half an iPhone 6 plus.  I've used it for about a week and a half and take one shower a day.  The size of the soap this morning was about the size of a quarter (after wadding up the remnants into a ball so that I could get every cent's worth of use out of it).  This stuff is really great in all ways except how long it lasts.  I wish the bar was about twice as big and was a little more dense, but, for $10 or even $7ish off their website, it's just flat not worth it.  I won't buy it again and the reviews about it not lasting are 100% true.  I thought those people were just clean freaks and took hour long showers three times a day.  I am not one of those people and it really really didn't last more than a week and a half.  I don't often write reviews on here, but, this one was such a bummer, I felt that I needed to add to the list of review.  So, if you have money to burn and don't care that that an entire bar of soap only lasts a week and a half, this stuff is friggen awesome.  But, if you don't want to spend $20-30 a month on bars of soap, stay away.  Picture below is after 10 days of use.\n",
            "Gold Moss 4/5: loved the smell and the soap itself. Didn’t leave me feeling dry and I like knowing that i’m using a natural soap without a bunch of chemicals. It gets a 4/5 because of the square shape and hard corners. After two or so weeks that goes away but I don’t like jabbing myself with non-rounded corners. I will be buying more of these!!Pine Tar 2/5: The only thing I like is the smell. I should have taken the name more seriously, the soap is black and leaves a black residue which is offputing. The soap is very abrasive and has bits of actual wood in it which I do not like at all!! I fell like i’m going to get a splinter every time I use it.I have yet to try the cedar citrus bar because the other two bars smelled better. I may update after trying it.\n",
            "I bought 1 of every available scent, and here are my \"firsts:\"1) This is the first time I've ever spent $10 for a bar of soap.  1a) This is the first time I've ever seen how small a bar of soap was and realized I was dramatically ripped off.2) This is the first time I've ever used soap once and could VISIBLY see that it was smaller afterward.3) This is the first time I've ever used soap that didn't leave me smelling like ANYTHING after I was done showering.4) This is the first time I've ever said this sentence: \"Boy, I sure won't ever buy THAT brand of soap again!\"The pic is how \"Bay Rum\" came out of the box (next to an old iPod for size reference). This bar was cut jagged, making a fissure in the corner that will break off within 1-2 uses. It's also cut unevenly, making this already small bar even smaller. This particular one also smells so faint, it's almost odorless. And in my first use, it was hard to lather. I am returning this for a refund.\n",
            "It is a fairly good bar of soap. I don't usually waste time with barred soaps because they all make my skin tight and dry. This one did not and thats mostly the reason its getting 4 stars. It smells great lathering and washing but it does not smell like anything more than an unscented soap by the time you get out of the shower. The scent does not last which is disappointing because I love smelling like I just rolled around in some pine chips..not kidding.The size of the bar is inadequate. Ive only had it since Monday, its Thursday now and its about half gone. I imagine it wont last longer than a week-tops at this rate.Smells great.Cleans great.Smooth and NOT dry or tight skin.Small size.Scent doesn't last at all.\n",
            "I’m a 58-year old manly male. I discovered Dr. Squatch just accidentally stumbling on one of their ads while on Facebook. It was nothing less than divine squatch intervention!I ordered the three-pack sampler. When the shipment arrived by SquatchEx, I stayed awake all night hitting trees with sticks, making howling sounds, and throwing rocks at unsuspecting passers by anticipating the experience. I tried the Pine Tar first, and I have not been disappointed! It is a squatchsome soap that left me feeling like I had just hiked naked up a pine-tree covered mountain with my pet bear (on his leash, of course).If you’re a manly man (like me), you really will like these soaps! Find your inner Squatch and get ‘em. They have my HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION!\n",
            "I finally caved in and bought this after seeing ad upon ad and video upon video of this soap bar, and a plethora of compliments on this soap bar. I think this Pine Tar scent is overplayed. I first got it and from the commercials; \"The garden of Eden\" and a girl mentioning she was staying for breakfast from the way it smelled on the commercial had me thinking \"okay, this is going to smell really good\".First thoughts:It does smell pretty good, however it did remind me of a grandpa cologne at first but I quickly shook that thought from my mind. I was also hoping that this bar of soap will last pretty long and that I won't have to buy another bar next week for $10.Initial Use:This bar is pretty abrasive but tolerable like taking salt in your hand and rubbing it on your skin (weird analogy right?) Anyways, I was not able to get it to lather up very well at all like in the commercial, barely any lather. It did turn the water black a little bit and left some black residue on me during passes (it rinsed off, so I am not concerned about it). My skin does feel refreshed and softer from the exfoliation caused by the bar.In conjunction with this soap bar, I also bought the Anwenk wooden soap holder thing for $6 to lay the Pine Tar bar on top of after rinsing it to help it last longer.Will update on occasion for how long it lasts.UPDATE 7/11/19:The picture shows 16 days worth of the bar of soap with no more than 30 seconds of lather for use. I rinse it, shake the water off and set it on the wooden thing.It smells and feel really nice, but $20 a month for a bar or soap is pretty expensive.\n",
            "This is great soap if you've got really dry skin, and you want a pure soap without all of the additives other soaps contain. I bought it a little over a week ago and am impressed by the texture of the soap, the way it makes my skin feel, and the overall smell. I did read many of the reviews online about the soap getting used up fairly quickly. So, heeding those warnings, when I use it, I turn the shower water off, and suds up and let it sit for a couple of minutes. It suds up nicely. After a week of use, I still have about 3/4 of a bar left. Enough to last through the rest of the month. CAUTION: If you are used to taking 30 minute showers and lathering up over and over again with soap, this soap will disappear fast. So, be wise, and use it sparingly. It's great soap if you do. I rated it 4 stars only because I have to go out of my way to turn the shower off and lather up to keep the soap from getting used up too quickly. Otherwise, for those of you looking for an all natural soap with glycerin, this is a good buy. I will probably purchase this again, and even try their other soaps.\n"

            "100% not for mostierising or sensitive skin. Dries my skin up immediately. I fell victim to the ads. Trust me its not worth it. Don't even bother it does nothing. I always thought soap was soap. But this is something like sandpaper. When you feel your skin after applying it you feel it out right away. And it leaves a waxy feel but some how still dries your skin. I've talked to a few people and they all have experienced the same.\n",
            "When I get the bars they where already melted and figured oh the truck was really hot and thats what happened.... WRONG....Soap dissolves once wet LIKE LITERALLY YOU SEE THE VAR FALLING APART... literally took 4 showers and the soap is just about done.... the smell i guess is only in the first couple layers because now it doesn't smell like anything but dial soap.... never will I buy it again... rarely do I write a negative review but the hype videos for this product lie to the consumer\n",
            "I'm 65 years old and this soap smells like something  I remember from my grandparent's house.  It smells more like a household cleaner than body soap.  It contains some gritty pieces as well.  Along with the pine tar, I purchase cedar citrus and it does smell some better.  The soap is square with very pointed edges.  Lastly, this soap is black.  When you leave this soap on a rack or touch the tub it will leave dark smudges that look like mold.  Not happy with this purchase.\n",
            "If you like strong perfumery feminine scents, this soap is not for you. If you wanna feel like you just stepped out of a log cabin to a crisp dewey forest morning and jumped in the river to wash off after chopping wood and swooning women, then look no further. This soap not only cleans better than anything I've ever tried previously, but it leaves a manly smell that lasts. A manly smell that smells... manly. Get yours today, you can't go wrong. And this lasts longer than any COLD PRESSED soaps I've tried. Cold pressed soaps tend to wear down faster than store bought chemical filled bars of sadness, so make sure you use a soap dish or a Dr. Squatch Soap Saver!\n",
            "I was really disappointed when I saw the size of the bar of soap when this came in the mail. I thought, “wow- okay! I paid $10 for this- it better be good!”The only thing I liked was the smell. It left my skin feeling really sticky, even after making sure it was washed off thoroughly.When I gave it to my son, he used it for about 11 days before it was gone.Not worth the money. Would not buy again.\n",
            "Ok so I really wanted to love this soap. I mean the commercials are just off the chain awesome and I would have to be honest that’s what sucked me in to the purchase while a lot of the reviews are good I think one thing Has to be considered this is soap and people are subjective and what they deem is good and not good. I think what bothers me most about the soap is not its quality but the sheer fact that is without a doubt the most awesome marketing scam of the year for me the soap cost approximately 10 bucks give or take maybe between eight and $10 depending On where you purchase it. It lasts approximately two weeks depending on how you use it let’s face it this is soap and it shouldn’t require a significant effort or accessories in order to make its value extended in plain English you have to put it on a soap draining rack in order for it not to disappear in short order. While they rave about its aroma In the commercials I found the scent to be minimal at least for the first one that I started using which was cedar citrus I was hoping to at least have that aroma as my shower buddy but I must say that it fell short by a significant percentage to be clear There are many more brands of boutique soaps on the market some even available in your local food store many of which are half the price of Dr. Squatch. To be fair I will post additional reviews as I try the other two soaps that were in the sample pack\n",
            "I saw the Youtube Ads for Dr. Squatch soap and when I saw they had one that looked sort of like an exfoliant (that smelled of pine), I became curious.I have sensitive skin- I'm cautious about what soap, soap powder, and lotion I use. I've had black Pine Tar Bar for about 3  days now and have used it for 2 nights. The black bar lathers decently, the pine scent isn't overpowering and is unnoticeable after you get out of the bath/shower and it's gentle enough that I can use the soap (lathered) on my face. My skin has not started to itch since starting this new soap, but I will do need to do further \"testing\" before I can make a final conclusion.I'm currently quite satisfied with my purchase and will update my \"review\" once I've used my bar up completely.If Dr. Squatch wants to get into the exfoliating body wash game, I'd like to try some of that too.P.S. : The suds will be black. Prepare for that.UPDATE:My soap's gone. The bar lasted 8 days (Friday to Friday). I still like how it lathers (and am still in awe of how it lathers white from a black bar) and leaves my skin feeling hydrated without overly fragrant and I used it on my face without breaking out.My review update won't change much but I don't know how I feel about buying a bar of soap once a week for about $10  (shipping included) when my skin has been subsisting on Zote soap (the manliest pink soap) for a fraction of that price.I believe this Pine Tar soap uses quality ingredients and that is what justifies the price.Just know what you're getting into because I've never heard of someone allocating their money for a soap budget.\n",
            "It simply does not last. Even aiming the shower head at it makes a black wash of water down the wall it errodes away so fast. Its a great smelling, cleansing soap but isnt worth what it will cost you over time buy having to buy 2-3 bars a month. All the reviews here on it not lasting are 100% spot on. They need to lower the price, make the bar much larger for the price, or simply find a way to make it last longer.  If it wasnt for that I would give it 5 stars all day.\n",
            "They have a decent marketing campaign, but a terrible product.  I liked the scent left behind, but I didn't feel clean afterwards, I felt greasy.  Six hours later I took another shower with my Castille organic, sustainable Shea butter liquid soap and all was right again.  I consider it theft to charge nearly $10 for something I threw in the trash after the first use.  There's plenty of low cost ($1-$3) bars of pine tar soaps on Amazon, I URGE you to try those first;\n",
            "It’s been almost two weeks now and my wounds have finally healed. Two weeks also marks my first shower using this product where I learned the pumice inside was no joke. The scent of natural pine paired with the black color was leaving me with a very masculine vibe. Imitating the IG ad I watched days prior, I began scrubbing my beard, face and head. So far so good... I moved to the arms and the chunks of what I have concluded as “wood” began to get a little aggressive. The closest comparison I could think of is my military days of using Lava soap or GoJo.  Giving the soap a full send, meaning that I was going to give it head to toe try, I continued to my legs. Lightening up on the pressure to the point where the soap was barely in my grasp, I toughed through the pain and finished up. It wasn’t until I began toweling off and glancing in the mirror that I noticed the red scratched all over my back, shoulders, face, and thighs. My next thought was someone could get accused of cheating using this soap, dangerous. Finishing my thought, I noticed blood on my towel. Investigating further, the source was a inch long gash along my outer shin/calf. It kind of resembled a deep briar scratch or if a large doggo had pawed down the side of my leg. Hesitant with my next shower, I had to use my fingernail to remove some of the more aggressive chunks of wood from the bar before use. Occasionally, I still feel a new one surface and have to decide if it’s going to be another skin ripper. Overall, I’m indifferent with this soap. The scent is great, color is awesome, texture... well I’ve said enough about that, and the lifespan is relatively short. I most likely won’t be purchasing another bar due the pumice. Though it feels good on your shoulders and back, the risk of being cut is too great if you’re not careful. I’m curious if the rest of their products are as aggressive? I’m a tough dude, but I shouldn’t have to prove it in the shower... unless it’s prison.\n"

            "This soap smells so good.Instantly I opened up a nice cardboard box the pine tar brick was kept in.My fiance could smell it through the amazon package.  She started to get all flustered and was curious what was in the package ?  I told her I had some manly man soap to lather my balls in now.  This was a huge turn on to her, as her biggest complaint was my fumunda cheese smelling testicles.  I almost instantly rushed into the shower to lather up the ole rod and tackle.To my surprise there was wood chips in the soap which actually happened to rip my sack and taint. ... it bled a little but was easily over looked because the smell was so freakin awesome.  The pine tar actually stuck to my skin so good I felt like I was covered in exactly that....pine tar.  Upon leaving the shower my fiance was literally glued to my testicles .... she couldnt keep them out of her mouth.This is the best soap ever created. After the best sex in my entire life I entered the bathroom to just look at that bar of soap for a second and to give my respects.  I looked in the mirror and noticed I instantly gained about 30 lbs and grew a full on beard. This stuff is better then advertised.I will buy again.\n",
            "I wanted to like it. I kept seeing the ads online and decided I'd throw it in with an amazon order and give it a try. This is not for guys that actually get dirty and need to actually clean themselves of dirt in the shower. I am a tradesman and after a long shift I need a long hot shower to be clean. This soap does a great job at cleaning your skin, but after less than a week of use the bar is completely gone. I can't afford a $40/month soap budget. I was not crazy about the pine tar fragerance nor was my old lady, but it did clean well. Due to the issues of it lasting though I will not be purchasing another Dr. Squatch soap product. Very disappointed.\n",
            "Bought the Black Pine Tar bar after being bombarded by adds on youtube. Got the bar uber excited dying to smell like a \"Man\". First time I used the bar, I thought I had to wait for the bar to blossom or something for the scent to be released. Smell was so faint that I had to literally touch my nose to the bar and then guess what it smelt like.The whole bar lasted maybe 15 days - bar literally evaporated into thin air - I used it to lather up on the upper body only and still just 15 day? I personally feel that WholeFoods and local Farmer's market bars are a lot more organic and a whole lot better in value.Garbage product, a ton of fake reviews and heavy marketing - These bars are total crap. Stay away.and yes, Amazon did refund my money.I\n",
            "Got the assorted three pack and had a chance to try all three different soaps...They lather up great but beware that these soaps soften up when they get wet and will wear down fast from normal usages...From what I am smelling there is very little difference in the after smell on my skin and all three seem to have a similar clean fresh decent scent but nothing like normal bar soap I also use...Also not advisable to leave any of these soaps in the shower because they will stay soft and drip leaving soap lines all over the shower...I actually found that after using either of the three I had to remove the bar and let it air dry on top of the prepackaged box it came in overnight before I could put it back into the box or use it again...Best way to use this sparingly is to wet your body then turn off the water and lather up then after your done doing this just turn the water back on and rinse off...The cons to using this soap is it’s expensive at nearly $10. Per bar and it’s small and will drip down into the sink or shower if it’s not completely removed from the humid shower Enviorment after you use it...Pros are it smells good, like a man’s smell but nothing like a cologne and afterward it leaves my skin like I used a lotion...Not advisable for using on your face!If this were half the price I’d buy more but the cost is just not worth buying...\n",
            "I genuinely do not get why this is a best seller or why it’s Dr. Squatch’s most popular soap; and I really do not get why people say its scent is amazing. It smells like the powder janitors pour on vomit in public schools when a kid pukes all over the place, or like one of those scented pads they put in a urinals with holes in them that we all use as a target.I admire this company for what they do, but Jesus does this soap not smell how you’d want smell after a shower.\n",
            "This is literally one of the worst products I have purchased on Amazon.First, it does NOT last. My wife and I take one shower per day each. We're less than one week into this $10.00 bar of soap, and it is almost gone. Maybe it will last one more day, but more likely one more shower. You can buy an $.89 bar of Dial at the grocery store that does what this does, and lasts twice as long.Second, it does not smell like pine. While it has a pine-y sent, it's something else. It does not smell good or refreshing.I saw this on a live feed ad (Instagram?) and it had good reviews. I like soaps that smell good, so I thought, \"What the heck,\" and gave it a try. Seriously? Ten bucks for a bar of soap?  This is such a bad product, I will not even consider anything else from Dr. Squatch.Oh yeah, one more thing. Its residue in the shower is black.  Black residue on your nice tile shower. Trust me, your wife will LOVE it....Save your money.\n",
            "Like a sharp shank shard of almond shell hidden inside your soap bar to slice your face like Jimmie did back in the prison yard?  Want soap that refuses to lather or actually clean anything?  Want to smell like you hugged a person who rolled on a forest floor for about ten minutes?  Then this soap is for you.If you like your soap to actually get you clean, have a scent that sticks around longer than 2 seconds and won't tear your skin off, then maybe buy some different soap.  This is overpriced garbage.\n",
            "Honestly, I was excited to try out this soap. Having used dove as far back as I can remember I wanted to change it up with this soap bar. Originally I saw it on a commercial on Facebook and thought, why not? The first day I tried it was fine, the smell was nice(pine was the first bar I tried). After using it for three days I started noticing that I started getting itchy all of a sudden. Eventually I got a rash all over my body because I was using this soap. Maybe it was an ingredient that I was allergic to but I stopped using it immediately and threw it all away. I went back to using dove for sensitive skin and my rash went away almost immediately. I like the idea behind this product, but I guess my body didn’t take a liking to it so much.\n",
            "I will start by saying that this soap has a lot of Pros and very little cons, its up to you to decide if it is worth it.Pros:-Smells great (the soap) see cons-body odor has been reduce to a minimum i can't actually believe how good this soap maintains body bacteria at its minimum levels, where you can barely smell your own smell, i usually smell a lot after a day of work i use deodorant and cologne, but after using this soap i am confused its like my scent has disappeared.-it exfoliating-its relaxing-its naturalCons-really expensive for a soap bar-the soap bar last for 2 weeks-the scent it leaves on you its a neutral odor, like soap without smell, like a cheap soap.-it drips all over walls and holders.Edit on Feb 15 19All of the above only applies to the black bar soap, all of the other bars suck.\n",
            "So the ingredients are top notch - smells great, cleans great, etc. However, it doesn't last long at all (for the price) and the \"block\" design is part of the problem - since there's so much more surface due to the block design, it dissolves a lot faster. There's a reason soap is more cylindrical and curved. Squatch is trying to be \"different\" with the block, but it's really just inefficient. If they can remold and compress the product, I think it'll be fantastic.\n"

            "Just like everyone else - we see these ads popped up all over social media and YouTube. They are starting to sponsor athletes like professional bass anglers, in which grabbed my attention to finally give it a shot.PROS:- Scents are memorable, strong and unique.- At $10 per bar they make great quick gifts, stocking stuffers, or for a specific trip 10 days or under.- Oatmeal in the bars are great exfoliators. Much better then plastic beads, or sand that genetic brands use.CONS:- The soap will deteriorate at a very fast rate. One bar will last 7-10 days depending on how you use it. You may get more time if you ration it however you see fit your showing agenda.- A single bar is $10.00 + tax, which is too expensive!! That is $40 + tax every month if you shower everyday.- I don't feel that much more moisturized then other soaps to be honest. I feel smooth in the shower after the initial rinse-off, but when I get out and dry-off, my skin is not as smooth in comparison to using body washes with moisturizers.For $10.00 per bar, I do not see the overall value in this product. I understand since the ingredients are small batch, and organic the soap will deteriorate at a much faster pace then traditional soaps and body washes. This bar lasted me less than a week!! That is terrible for a bar of soap. That is $40+ tax for soap per month? That is outrageous. Even before I used and tried this brand - I read plenty of reviews to make sure I did everything necessary to slow down the deterioration rate of the soap - but honestly it went faster then most other reviews anticipated.\n",
            "I purchased the Pine Tar soap and was not satisfied. I had never purchased anything like this before so went in kind of blind and relied on the overall customer reviews. The soap smells like a car freshener to me. I sent in an email explaining this and even stated I would be willing to try something else because I usually try to give new companies a couple chances to earn my business. The response I got back was a generic one that was very obviously computer generated. Haven't heard a word back from the company since. Very disappointed in how the issue has been handled.\n",
            "Smells Terrible, the pine cone or whatever is put in to exfoliate cut my skin.  I dislike the smell, girlfriend absolutely hates it, lives a residue on skin she can taste.  Commercial was all about how nice it smelled, paid actors.  I tried to switch them with dr. squatch for another one, but they denied it.  The bar will only last 4-5 showers max, so be aware you will be spending $30 a month on soap.  1 star for me, except for moisturizing, as it's suppose to be all natural so it gets 2 stars for that.  One and DONE for me.\n",
            "It is a bit different to use at first, but after getting the hang of it, I love it. How do you get the \"hang\" of using soap? Well, firstly, when you go to lather up, it feels like there is no lather (aka bubbles) initially. I was super dissapointed, but then I lathered up a second time and whoa, it lathered up great. I take it that the soap is emulsifying the oils on the skin the first time. My skin felt great after each shower and the smell was perfect. It was subtle enough that I could smell it and my wife could when she snuggled up to me in bed. I even did some animal testing (not really, but kinda) since it was made for sensitive skin, I used it on the cats when giving them a bath. It made their fur super soft and helped clear up one of their dry skin problems they were having causing them to scratch and lick constantly.\n",
            "I had high hopes for this after seeing all of the marketing ads and reading reviews but sadly it did not live up to the hype.I did really like how well it lathers. Unfortunately that is really all I liked about it.It smells like a combination of Pine-sol an Toilet bowl cleaner. I know its supposed to smell like pine but this was a very chemical cleaner pine scent.In many review people complained about how quickly it degrades so I tried to extend its life by using a wash cloth, but even with that it was gone in less than 2 weeks. At $10 per bar I was hoping it would last at least a month. Yes I do take a shower every day.Not a huge deal but it does leave a black soap trail in the tub. It didn't bother me but my wife was less than thrilled.I gave Dr. Squatch a try after testing various scents of Duke Cannon \"Big Ass Brick of Soap\", and after having tried it I will go back to Duke Cannon. They smell better, cost less, and last WAY longer.\n",
            "I loved this as soon as put it on in the shower. I work in a machine shop and I constantly get oil on me and dust from the metals cause my arms to have large black spots. At work we have 3 different soaps that used in most machine shops. Even after a day of work scrubbing my arms with those soaps and even with a small brush the black spots will stay and even last for a week. Sometimes is embarrassing because if I go out after work and I wear short sleeves u can see some of the dirt on my arms from work. When I got this I used it the same day and I was instantly amazed how fast it got off all the dirt and oil stains on my arms. It even took out the smells of an old machine shop off of me. I also have dry sensitive skin and I did instantly know my darker skin tone wasn't as ashy as using years of different kinds of body washes. I felt like I had hit a home run with this soap. I'm honesty so astonished how all natural soap can do all these things. I was always a skeptic when it comes to these kinds of all natural soap bars. If your a man that works in shops or work dirty jobs or even if you don't I recommend this 100%. I told all the guys at work about this and my manager is ordering some to keep at the shop for when we wash up after work.\n",
            "Here is a tip to make the bar last longer (as with all artisan soaps). Buy some disposable rubbermaid food containers that are about 4\" wide, they come in a pack of 5 and their about 2\" tall and only a few bucks. This will protect your bar and you will get 3-4 weeks out of it. If you don't have or can't find something like that always remember to keep the bar of soap away from being streamed with water. One picture I have seen is a bar of soap running down the side of the tub. This is easily avoidable if you just keep if from being showered on when not in use. Keep it high, dry and out of the way.I originally purchased this soap to use in my beard but decided what the heck use it on the body every day. It's fantastic. Might leave you feeling like you have dry skin for about 10 mins but then your skin starts to soften back up. Now I use the Pine Tar exclusively on the beard, beard and beard. If you have a beard, ditch those bottled beard shampoos for some of this Pine Tar! Depending on how you use it in your beard it can be a strippier or mild wash. My face and beard have not been this healthy in years. My beard is 10\". This soap can handle a beard like a boss! Your beard will be cleaner, fuller looking and overall more healthy after only a few weeks. I love this stuff!Now I have caved in and am using their other soaps for the body and buy the shampoo and conditioner. Don't know how they did it, but they got me hooked.\n",
            "Got the well packaged,great smelling,good lathering,very tough on stink and grime.the manly fragrance lasts for hours,I work indoors&outdoors for a living, day in and day out,I normally shower twice daily in the summer months,but I noticed for some Reason I didn't feel like it was as necessary as normal to shower upon waking up.as I normally do..hell I actually felt confident enough I was able to skip a few morning showers because of this stuff.im not saying i smelled shower fresh after waking.but i noticed i definatley still felt cleaner than with my normal soap.ive been a die hard AXE fan for years..but honestly this squatch soap is the best I've ever used. I love it.the only thing I noticed was that the bar lasted me about 10 days......I can't fault the bar or the inventor for that..if anyone knows a good bar of soap it's me.i work my ass off.and get dirty and sweaty at times,this stuff cuts right through normal filth.its not a degreaser..it's a great body soap.id love to buy a bar every ten days I'm not exactly sure yet I can . probably will buy one more still.if it came in a much bigger bar at a better price.id be a customer for life.i can't compliment it enough.i like it.\n",
            "OK, so this is just insane soap. Smells really good but key is to rinse quickly and not stay in the water after using or the great smell will run off. The soap lathers like if you installed a water softener on a hard water line so it is worth the buy for that part. At the price I think it is on the high side but it is good soap without the harsh stuff so you pretty much paying for the high life. Remember that you must rinse off quickly and not camp out on the shower or the smell will seriously run off, no bs. I did use it only one time so I wanted to test it but normally that should be enough to keep you smelling good but because I stayed in the shower with running water at 120 degrees maybe the smell ran off my pores hahaha.... I was told that this soap is being mass produced so that could be it but because I dont use this and this is my first time I can't really say its crap soap. Im a first time buyer and I think this is more of a $5 soap because the smell is not close to your commercial ad. I give it a 7 out of 10, but I will not buy again only for the fact that the hype was that it smelled good, the problem is it was for like 2 minutes..... Have to say dirt smells better longer.....lol\n",
            "When I received this soap, I thought there is simply no way I would be able to stand such a strong smell! However, my husband is a Yeti and prefers Pine Tar soap, so we have been trying them all. As it sat on the bathroom counter awaiting its turn in the shower I just thought \"oh lord, this is way too strong smelling!\" So the fine gents at Dr. Squatch suggested the Gold Moss bar, which I bought - much less strong of a sent. Funny thing, though. Once the Pine Tar bar was getting its turn in the shower, I became so fond of it that when it came time for Gold Moss, I found I missed the scent of Pine Tar! We just received our three pack of Pine Tar and I can't wait for Gold Moss to be done (although it's very nice, don't get me wrong). Both Lady and Yeti Wetzel are very happy with this product. A tip for those who say it gets used up too fast. If you are hairy like my Yeti, maybe don't use your chest hair like a flippin' cheese grater with that bar! Get a bath sponge, apply bar to sponge, apply sponge to Yeti. It lasts three times as long, and you will be just as clean. I have tried many many pine tar soaps, and this one is a keeper! Highly recommend.\n"

            "Let's get this out the way now! I used this soap and my lady has been on top of me 24/7 since. She loves the smell and refuses to leave me alone. On top of the smell the feel is superb when using it. A very welcomed experience in the shower. And yes I've done all the research! Here's the rundown: 1 bar of soap will last the average person 2weeks. (Pretty short, but it is an all natural product) People that don't like the price, if you buy on the Dr.Squatch website its 2-3$ cheaper but takes almost 3weeks to get to you. If you want to eliminate the middle man completely order it from the source TheSoapGuy.com. Where it can be bought in bulk at a good price and shipped to you in about a week. But if you need it before a hot date this coming weekend to ensure the lady falls in love with you at first hug, then Amazon is the quickest way to get it. You won't be disappointed its an awesome soap in all honesty!\n",
            "So I originally bought bay rum accidentally, in stead of nautical sage.  I actually bought Dr. Squatch thinking maybe I'll use it once maybe twice to say I tried it, and now here I am buying my third bar, and considering a subscription. This soap smells amazing and you feel clean. My favorite even though I mistakenly ordered it originally is bay rum. I have yet to try cedar citrus, but thats already on the way. The fact I keep coming back should say enough. However if you don't want to take my word for it, try it yourself and remember you get what you pay for; because you can't put a price on feeling clean and smelling great, and the fact you're actually clean.\n",
            "This is the comment I get from the wife after using Dr Squatch.  Prior to this I had always used the gold bar of personal detergent, but was getting really itchy, dry skin.  I thought I was starting to have problems with the water softener, but it turns out it was my old soap.  I tried to use a moisturizer soap but did not like any of them.  They all turned to mush and smelled like baby powder.  I decided to give Squatch a try after watching the video ad and within a few days of using this soap my skin was no longer itching after the shower.  I like the results so much I signed up for the subscription service.  Now the entire family is using these soaps.  We have tried most of the varieties and our favorites are the pine tar, cedar citrus, golden moss scrub, nautical sage and spearmint basil scrub.  And yeah, I really do smell good. ;-)\n",
            "This is not for sensitive skin. I was excited to try the pine tar soap. Two uses.I thought it was my shirt after the shower making me itchy. It turns out the soap completely dried me out to the point of getting lotion (I despise lotion) I broke out in rashes on my chest and back.If you are naturally oily this may be for you. Not me.\n",
            "My son bought me my first bar and so I used it as a way to be nice to him and didn't expect to like it. Normally, I'd never buy a scented soap of any kind as they have all proven to cause rashes on my skin, breathing problems, or left a strange odor (Neutrogena). In fact, Ivory has been the only soap I've been able to use without a problem (except for dry skin). Until now.I've since purchased this soap twice. The scent is relatively mild and has not caused me issues with my skin or my breathing. I'm now on my third bar of it and intend to continue using it.However, I'm still not a fan of the scent. If they offered a non-scented version, I'd buy that instead. But that's because I have grown averse to any scented product as I can have a lot of breathing/skin issues with them. But because I've not had an issue with the sage scent, part of me is happy that I can finally use a product with a scent. So, maybe I'd stick with it after all.\n",
            "Dr. Squatch is different than your run of the mill soap.  Their marketing is great, and who doesn't love Sasquatch related things?  The longer than normal haired blonde male is a great spokesman, and sells soap like no one I've ever seen.  I can't ride a horse shirtless like the Old Spice guy, with wash board abs, and a voice of an angel.  What I can do is be a little chubby, with a beard, and like the outdoors. And that is fitting with this soap.  Fancy soap for the normal male population.  Now to the soap itself;The cold press soaps create nice lather, but the bar will not last as long as a standard off the shelf bar.  There are reviews about this explaining the process.  I'm not a soap maker, so I don't (or need to know) the details of that.  I am, however, an avid soap user.  For many years I have used soap daily.  (multiple times a day in some cases)  Again, the soap has a nice lather, full and frothy.  Rinses clean, and leave a subtle scent that isn't overpowering.  As stated before by other daily users, these bars don't have the longevity of your normal bar soap.  They are delicate bars, swiftly fading into oblivion, until you're left wondering which scent to use next.In summary; It's nice soap, that does what regular soap does, but does it somewhat better.  Give it a shot, then decide.  It doesn't disappoint, just keeps you clean.\n",
            "For nearly $10 a bar, your paying for mostly the awesome commercials. See below1:  stright out of box Scent is NOTHING like any other major store bought, truly awesome. I order 3 samplers and I enjoy the gold moss and soothing aloe the best. (There is no aloe in the aloe go figure only fragrance.2: all the ingredients are truly readable and nothing fishy, they must be \"better\" for you.THE BAD, or not so good1: like many other non paid legitimate consumers, I feel super \"grippy\" after I rinse off throughly. If you used normal cheap bar soap in the past, be prepared for that sticky grippy feeling again. It does go away a bit after toweling off but not what I was expecting.2: after about 2 showers, the bar looses 80% of its scent, to the point where in about 30 minutes after shower, I don't smell anything on my skin. To make yours last longer (and not get germs and bacteria) work a lather in your HANDS, AND THEN use that lather all over. Repeat. This bar will NOT LAST long with direct pressure on body. It does Sud up really good though which is a good thing.3:  See picture 2:super aggressive and uncomfortable to \"exfoliate\" with. I personally don't rub it on my own body as your soap gets germs all over it. But idk how anyone could use this. Way too aggressive to rub bar on skin4: price.... I could justify $5 max for a bar of soap like this. He's going to be yours But this is truly all hype. I do admit my skin is a \"wee\" bit less dry but nothing to write home about.5: THE MESS! Be prepared to have black looking goop that is harsh to rub off. I don't mind it but most people have white tubs. Yikes if you care about your tub looking white. Even though my soap is not getting hit by water, it melts and bonds to my soap shelf leaving a layer of black goop. I don't have this issue with other bar soap. See my pictures.Worth a try, but wouldn't buy again.\n",
            "I bought this soap for my teenage son who has dry skin and he was excited about trying it.  After one use of the Pine Tar soap (like as soon as he used it)  his face broke almost immediately (see Pic)  I ended up having to spend money on medicine to reduce the allergic reaction.  I bought the three pack and now he can't use any of them.  I was very disappointed after reading positive reviews about how it was so good for the skin.  Obviously people have allergies, I get that, but this hasn't ever happened with any other soap product he has used. Not only was the soap expensive for the three pack, but now medicine on top of that!  Just not a good experience for us.\n",
            "It smells great from the outside, but it doesn't work as advertised. Overall bad experience1. It doesn't lather well at all2. It doesn't smell or work better than other typical shower gels3. The pieces of pinewood feel horrible on your skin (can leave you looking like you got in a cat fight)4. The soap leaves a black residue behind that's very annoying.In conclusion, It's way too expensive for what it actually does, verse what a common bar of soap is worth. It works better as an air freshener than a bar of soap.FWIW: I got to put this straight to the test with my long time girlfriend who notices literally everything. I tried this soap for 3 straight days and she never noticed or said a thing (and she's the type of girl who would point out if a single hair was out of line) So it's not just me, this soap just isn't what it's cracked out to be.\n"

            "I can’t hate the makers of this soap for their marketing abilities… they finally made me buckle. Every app that has an ad pop up or swipe up, shows this company and their soap. What I was hoping for was a bar of soap that made me clean, smell fresh and hopefully last a while. What I got was 3 bars of soap that cost me roughly $10 per bar, a bathroom that smelled better, but unless my wife lost her sense of smell, she says I smell no different. No better, no worse. The bar last’s about 2 weeks. Yes, I bout that little wood piece of shit holder, too. One of the bars stuck to it and when I tried to pry soap off, one of the pieces of wood popped off. Sweet quality. I like a sticky bar of soap! As far as what is advertised, this is like a grown man’s Axe body spray. If/when my wife ever leaves me, I’ll give this product another go to see if anyone else thinks I smell as advertised… until then, I’m going back to a bulk of Dove from Costco.\n",
            "Tiny bar that lasted fifteen days. For about six dollars a week this stuff is garbage. Stored it on an open air bar rack. The instructions advise one to use the bar directly on the skin for the exfoliating benefits. You can see a ton of soap being wasted as you follow these instructions. The only reason it felt like a nice lather was because of the insane amount of soap on my skin. Also the smell is pleasant but super weak. Give up on any hope's of this stuff giving an aromatic shower stall experience and obviously there will be no lasting scent on the body after....very lame considering the advertising!  There are many products out there that will better suit your needs. There are bars without the nasty chemicals that are much cheaper, as effective if not more effective, that also smell up the bathroom nice, are still made in the US, are six times larger, and are good for your skin.  My grocery store sells an African black soap by Shea Moisture which is all of these things for about six dollars after tax. They are a B Corp to boot. I will never waste twelve dollars on a tiny bar of this crap Dr.Squatch again!\n",
            "I was a little indifferent towards this soap when I first started using it, but after a few weeks I have grown to love it. It lathers great and because of the pine tar and charcoal it contains you feel super clean after using it and I noticed I started to crave the smell when it was getting close to shower time..a little strange I know. Your skin health will improve after repeated use. I have eczema and it has almost all gone away. Now for the reasons I gave it four stars instead of five. I wish it lasted longer. I’m a 6’ guy with an average build and I get about 12 showers out of one bar. There are tricks though to get it to last longer. Some like to cut it in half (which I haven’t tried yet, but will) and also keeping it DRY between showers is a must. Any soap dish that exposes it to the air underneath will do, you don’t want it sitting in a puddle. And you don’t need to buy their $18 “soap saver”. Also this soap is expensive! It is cheaper on their website and if you opt for the subscription it comes to about $6 per bar. But if you look around online for ‘cold process natural soap’ you can find it for cheaper and also you could check and see if locally in your area any shops make or carry it. Overall it is a great soap and I don’t see myself ever going back to those men’s shower gels. So if the price doesn’t bother you, get it.\n",
            "I bought this for my teen son after he asked me to get it for him. The commercials are truly hilarious and it’s made in the USA so I figured, why not. It’s pretty expensive at $10 for a small 3 x 3 bar (estimating size). My son does love the smell (I thought it was a bit strong) and he did say it made his dry skin feel softer. Unfortunately, the bar only lasted 3 showers. I will admit my son takes long showers and he does have OCD so maybe it would have lasted 6 to 7 showers with normal use. All in all I will probably buy it again for him if he asked me to. (Because he is a spoiled only child) We might go broke if this ever becomes his full time favorite soap. I honestly believe they need to lower the prices. The price is the biggest downfall for Dr. Squatch!\n",
            "So like most I saw some good reviews and thought I would give it a try is it a great soap no not really. The smell is why I got this soap thinking it would have  woodsy smell. Well the smell that comes to mind is comet cleaner and pine sol cleane,. not a fresh walk in a forest. Exfoliation  sure I think there are wood chips in the soap that what it feels like or a green scrubbing pad for pots and pans. Come to think about it have you ever used a chainsaw to down some a trees well after a while when chain is dull it will start to tear wood shaving not cut them. take that wood add comet and pine sol press into a bar and there is the soap in a nut shell. on a good note it does rinse off clean you don't feel any residue like other soap that's why the 2 stars.\n",
            "#1 Ceder citrus: definitely just cut down a pine tree.Great earthy pine/ cedar smell exactly what I was hoping for!#2 Pine Tar: really unsure how I feel about this one. I like it, but it's not what I was expecting. I've has a different brand of pine tar soap in the past with smelled like I worked on my Jeep all day and took a shower with dirt and leaves from the woods. (I enjoyed it) this brand however I can't describe the smell besides a hint of mint maybe?#3: gold moss: another tricky smell, almost like your grandparents potpourri but it's got a spicy/ sweet smell, almost like dessert not sure. Definitely worth a shot I however will probably not be buying it again.The picture of the soap cut in half shows the fresh base and a bar with about 3 washes.(I heard cutting them in half would make then let longer, who knows but at this rate I'll likely get 2 weeks out of one (whole) bar.)I will likely being buying 3 cedar citrus bars next time, I am more then happy with those.I definitely recommend this company!\n",
            "Purchased this just to give it a shot.1. Bar is impossible to use straight out of the box, you have to cut it in half.2. Scent is barely even there, whoever says this stuff has a long lasting scent is nuts.3. It literally lasted 2 weeks and that was with minimum use, just ridiculous.There is FAR better soap out there, for cheaper and that last. Support told me to email them which I did a week ago seeing what they would say, they never followed up. So not only does the product hit a 2/10, but their support just isn't there.Spend your money elsewhere.\n",
            "UPDATE: 3.5 stars. The soap has its flaws and advantages, but I must say the life of the soap leaves a lot to be desired. I understand it is organic and clean, but with optimal care to keep the soap away from puddles of water and to make sure it was elevated and dry the soap lasts about 3 weeks and 3 days. So if you are fine with the short life of the soap then its a good deal I guess. For me its ok for a splurge, but budget wise not high on the priority list. But really nice soap wish it was cheaper.So first impressions: The soap is black and creates black suds kinda weird but kinda manly. The smell of the Pine Tar is not that great in my opinion kinda pine sol smelling. The smell doesnt last long after you finish showering too but you kinda expect that considering the natural ingredients (there is a positive will address in a minute). Also it has like wood chips embedded in the soap so straight skin to soap contacting does not feel that great. The price is very high for a bar of soap and the reviews are littered with complaints that it does not last. $10 for a bar of soap is pretty expensive. With these factors themselves I would have ranked this smell and soap quality as like 2 stars...... but there are some things that are kinda amazing. The thing that is amazing is this soap does not leave any kind of residue when you finish. Your skin feels super clean but not chemically tainted clean. You feel like everything got exfoliated by a ghost or something. Your SKIN feels great. The smell afterwards you dont have like a cologne lingering smell, but what you do have is a faint smell of pine but most importantly just a neutral no body odor kinda zen smell. For that I give this 2 extra stars. So as a package I give it 4 stars\n",
            "Alright so I’ve now tried this product and I personally love it. I like the scent and even my girlfriend said she likes the scent. It doesn’t last long I will agree but as long as you don’t put it under the water, while not in use and use a soap saver like the cheap one in the picture I got from Walmart, you should be fine. Also I’ve seen a complaint about price. If you go to their website the bars are 7$ and if you buy in bulk meaning a purchase of 40$ or more its free shipping and if you subscribe to get products they get even cheaper. The price issue honestly is Amazon raising the price for essentially being a third party seller. As far as being good for sensitive skin, I have very sensitive skin and this stuff doesn’t bother my skin at all. Usually the heavy perfume ones that do have a longer lasting scent end up agitating my skin so I have no complaints. If you guys have any more questions feel free to ask me. I’ve tried pine tar and just ordered nautical sage and bay rum.\n",
            "So I’ve been subscribed to Dr. Squatch soaps for a little over a year and was buying it sporadically before that. I loved it at first, I have sensitive skin so finding a soap that doesn’t irritate my skin is challenging sometimes - I had zero skin irritation from Dr. Squatch at first but I’ve noticed in the last 4 months it’s been drying my skin out more than it used to (and not just because of the winter weather and my heat being on). I have always kept my soap bars on a drying tray that sits out of any spray from my shower head and it never used to be a problem, I could use the entire bar until it was a little sliver of soap left. But the last 3 bars I’ve received have completely crumbled. The first one did it after maybe two weeks, about half the bar had been used. The second one actually took longer but I noticed that whatever the litte hard things they put in the soap bars to help exfoliate, that bar after it crumbled it was legit like 50% that stuff and maybe 50% soap. I figured maybe it was just a bad batch or something. Then I got my latest bar of soap..... it lasted 8 days. There was so much stuff that was not soap in the bar that it literally just disintegrated in my hand. Now I don’t know if I’m the odd one here but Normally with any other bar of soap I will take the broken pieces and just mold them back together with my hands so I can at least use it, you know, like just squeezing them back together - the remains of this bar would not stick back together. It was like trying to get wet sand to stay in one shape. So, I don’t know what to say - I loved it at first but it seems like the quality control has been lacking lately.\n"

So I get the soap and realize right away its a huge brick compared to other soaps so I dont feel soo horrible about paying $10 for a bar of soap since it seems to have more product than other $5 bars.  The smell is nowhere near what I thought it would be. It smells good, do't get me wrong but its not something that a girl would say \"\"oo0ohh\" about so don't buy into that gimmick. Clever marketing trick though ill admit ( You guys got me!)Pros:  *Big brick so it last longer than traditional shaped soap bars  * Activated charcoal works well for my skin , and the black water is kind of cool  *Its true it does not leave your skin dry, skin feels pretty good after a shower.Cons:  *$10 a bar can end up costing you a lot if you stick with this as a every day soap.  *The PineTar one has some nice size chunks of oatmeal that go a bit further than exfoliate lol If you had a  sunburn or soft sensitive skin this would not be a fun bar of soap to use  *Buyers remorse after you realize it does not smell anything like the commercials make you believe.\n",
            "I did not enjoy this product at all!! First off, it is organic meaning that typically it’s not going to last very long (give or take a week). Second, the scent was not very strong or long lasting. Third, It contained sand in it??? I’m thinking to exfoliate??? But I really don’t need that clogging my drain!  Lastly, it was very expensive. I could could get two bottles of Old Spice, and smell great, for the price of one bar of this stuff. No brainer! I will say the marketing on this product was awesome (see video). I will give it that. This soap contained oatmeal.....????! As a man my skin needs only a few things and oatmeal is not one. Oatmeal belongs in my stomach!!! Thank you.\n",
            "I’m having difficult understanding why this soap has mostly good reviews. It’s over 4 stars out of 5, with over 52,000 reviews, at the time I’m writing this. That’s nuts, because it’s not very good soap AND it’s overpriced by a wide margin. I also think “cost per ounce” is the metric that is needed.I just bought 1 bar (even though the price is a tad higher that way), because I wanted to see if it was good enough soap for me.The Good:- It smelled really nice while using it. The smell lasted in the bathroom, too, which was cool.- It lathers decent. (The commercial show even more lather, however. Weird.)- Each bar is 5 ounces, and that’s a decent sized bar.- Funny marketing. (Although that’s gone now; read more below.)The Bad/Ugly:1.It’s massively overpriced, when you look at it “per ounce of soap”. I paid 10 dollars for 5 ounces of soap. (That is 2 dollars an ounce.) Compare this to Irish Spring soap (also sold on Amazon), which is 14 cents per ounce. That means Dr. Squatch is over THIRTEEN TIMES the price! I know that you can get Dr. Squatch cheaper by buying in bulk, but from what I’ve seen, that still doesn't bring the price nearly in line with other soaps. (If not for the other downsides, this item ALONE would make this a 2 star product.)2.Despite using a soap saver, it lasts SIMILAR to most other bars of soap. But given the price (see item 1, above) that’s not a huge selling point. It needs to last over 10 times longer than other soaps.3.There were oats in the soap, and they were very abrasive to my skin. The oats were hard, and it felt like being scratched with fingernails, on 1 side of the soap, whenever I used that side to rub against my skin. (The other side was coincidentally smoother, which was good. But I don’t like inconsistency.)4.My skin was MORE DRY than normal after my shower. I have dry skin, in general, and that’s not the soaps fault. But it was worse after using this.5.The supposedly evil “synthetic detergent” found in most soaps isn’t actually bad for you to soap up with. It’s just a marketing gimmick, to make other soaps seem bad. And I fell for it! Darn it!6.Some people are giving lots of advice on how to make the soap last longer. No bar of soap should require that much work and thought.7.When the bar had about 20% left, it started breaking into small chunks. It became incredibility brittle. I was able to “salvage” most of the pieces by adding them to another bar new bar of soap, so this is probably not a big deal.8.The soap leaves dark (or black) residue in my shower. I know it’s not dirty, but it looks dirty.9.The “funny marketing” is no longer funny to me. Now it just mildly irritates me, knowing I won’t ever buy it again; and it’s probably tricking other people.10.If you shop around, there are other “homemade style bars of soap” that are several times cheaper. Maybe not as cheap as a mass market soap, like Irish Spring, or Dove. But several times cheaper, and similar quality.\n",
            "Bought this after I saw the ads on how “manly” this makes you. I expected something different than just a standard exfoliating bar of soap. It didn’t do anything special as far as moisturizing, and didn’t feel much different than typical dove men’s bars. It does have the scratchy feeling that exfoliating bars have, so if you think that’s helpful, it has it.The most annoying this is the gray film that comes off of the black bar. It made it seem like I was getting rid of a bunch of extra dirt, but it’s really just the coloring of the bar rubbing off.Lasted about a month of daily showers, so I’m not spending $10 for another month.If you talk to people a lot about what type soap you use and looking “manly” and like spending lots of money, maybe this is the product for you. If you just want a good bar of soap for a good price there are other products out there.\n",
            "According to my friends, I used to be a bit of a Dirty Diana... I guess that's just Human Nature when you're busy Workin' Day and Night. Anyways, I digress. I was searching high and low for a natural soap that could cut through my manly musk and clean me up.  Nothing seemed to do the job until Dr. Squatch - boy oh boy You Rock My World. The scent of this soap gives me Butterflies. I was in a State of Shock when I realized just how clean, exfoliated, and fresh I was. These days, my friends tell me I'm the Smooth Criminal of the group... I guess that's why all my exes are always telling me \"I Want You Back\". If you're in competition with Dr. Squatch, tough news... there's no way you'll Beat It.\n",
            "Smells great, but I felt that it lacked the quality that I’ve found in many other soaps.  I prefer local soap makers, as the quality is phenomenal.  After seeing commercials for this, I was excited to try it since my boyfriend is difficult to buy for.  I purchased this for him as a gift, but was pretty disappointed in its overall quality.  First, the black color of the soap doesn’t disappear as it suds.  When the soap was sitting in its holder, black color would drain down the shower walls.  That was frustrating, but what was really disappointing was how quickly it ran out.  Typical artisan soaps last a few weeks (sometimes a month) in our shower.  This soap lasted maybe two weeks.  For the price tag, that just didn’t make sense to me.  As a gift for someone this is a fun add on, but it isn’t something I would choose to keep purchasing.\n",
            "Alright, so I ordered the Pine Tar scent, and I have to admit that not only did I love the smell, the sand feels great when scrubbing. The only real issues I had with the soap were that its odd shape made it difficult to find a place to put it down between showers (in the future I'll probably just cut the bar in half), and that it didn't last as long as a lot of soaps I've used.However!I'm a guy with very long hair, and the bits of sand in the soap had a wonderful side effect: it was a hair magnet! All the loose hair that sits on my body would get collected by the soap, and I could not only dispose of it easily without it going down the drain, but I also never had a problem with leftover strands after the shower. That single thing makes this the best soap I can think of for long-haired guys, and even though I've tried a couple of other types of soap since I last used this up, I'll be buying more Dr. Squatch the next time I need any.\n",
            "I bought this product twice. The first time I bought it I was pleasantly surprised how good it smelled and how easy it was apply to the skin. The second bar had no smell it wasted away super fast and had no scent. It was basically black tar. When you buy a product you expect it to work each and every time. Especially at a premium.  That's why I will not buy it again.\n",
            "The smell is fantastic, definitely the best thing about the product but be careful!  If you use this to wash anything sensitive....yes, those, then be gentile because there are sharp scrubby things that can best be described as shards of walnut shells that will really wake you up!  I used this bar on my chest and it actually left some pretty harsh scratches.  Another thing is, the bar doesnt last very long.  I would say about 2 weeks tops.  It seems to melt away pretty quick so at almost $10 a pop, not really worth it if you are going to use it every day.\n",
            "This is hands down the best freaking soap I’ve ever used... My skin is sensitive, and prone to eczema to the point that I just stopped using soap altogether for close to a decade, unless it was dial gold, and then only for tattoo aftercare, or washing my hands after using the toilet... I got by just fine For the most part, using a loofah, but on one of those particularly nasty post camping trip days, my homies girl practically begged me to use his soap in the shower. I did so begrudgingly, expecting to wake up covered in rashes, but to my delight, I went to bed feeling squeaky clean, and woke up feeling clean and smooth... I loved the smell of it too, not astringent in the slightest, and how the bar itself had built in exfoliation... So I asked what kind it was, and two years on I still love the hell out of this soap, and use it every time I shower, with no repercussions except maybe one... My girl won’t leave me alone. 😀\n"

            "If it seems expensive, it is. Here’s my main takeaways:I’ve been using one of the bars continuously since arrival.  Smell isn’t particularly strong, (unlike the advertising where a few birds start getting frothy based on the smell) which is disappointing. That’s what I was really looking forward too. Patience young padawan.Surely... by the end of my first bar and well into a month of aggressively scrubbing my bollocks with this soap I would see results. Shouldn’t I?Any difference? To either skin softness or the appearance? Nope.Na. Not really. It doesn’t smell pungent enough for me.. was hoping the cedar one would be spectacular matching my aftershave 😞I like the idea. I like the concept. And anyone else who likes them and the apparent smell, well more power to you. And it’s not full of crap you would usually find inside soaps. Great, great selling point and one of the reasons I pulled the trigger.However it’s not worth it. it’s not really $30 worth of beauty products if you ask me. And if you like to look after yourself like I do, I feel ‘dr squatch’ are taking the piss by charging that.Based on the commercials I was expecting numerous, highly charged females getting ready to pounce on me! Eyeballing me like I was cake on cheat day. However it was not to be. No such luck. I blame that twat, James Schrader.\n",
            "My husband wanted to like this so badly.  He likes the smell of it, I personally can't even smell it and he says his skin feels smoother.  BUT for the price of almost $10 for 1 single bar of soap you would expect it to last more than a week, right?  After 4 days of use (1 shower a day) ONLY BY HIM, the bar is a small little piece that hopefully he will get 1 more wash out of it.  Extremely disappointed.  Will not order again.  I encourage you to not waste your money.\n",
            "the soap is good but i  subscribed to aloe they were all out and the dr squatch employee goes \"it's not aloe anyway.\"then my order of 9 bars 12/17.20  is still not here. i complained 1/7/21 they priority shipped a replacement and billed me again. I'm amazon spoiled but this is nuts. It's sad all these young people work there and they are excited about a new beginning of something good. #1 they use the the US post office. 2. products are fake. 3. they bill you for their mistakes. I called my bank and cancelled all charges to doc squatch. by the way drano wont touch a drain clog with the melt in your hand soap either. It all started so clean.\n",
            "Not really sure how I ended up here but here's my review. I've never bought dr.squatch from Amazon but I do have subscriptions for their soap, shampoo and conditioner, deodorant and yes toothpaste. As for the soap, if you leave it to soak in your shower on the shelf then yeah, its going to last only a few days. But If you store it properly it will last close to a month, at least it does for me with daily showers lathering up multiple times. Get yourself a soap saver, you can get them here on amazon for a few dollars or you can get a pack of mesh bags here as well, I use them for traveling every week. Also just don't get pine tar, in my honest opinion its over played and far from their best scent, get you some bay rum or spearmint basil. Their adverts are annoying and certainly over played but their products are nice and their customer service is absolutely great.\n",
            "I’m a man who lives alone so I’m the only one using the shower. I saw people say to make this last to remove it from direct water while not in use (since I assume their family/room mate also uses the same shower) but even leaving it on the little shelf opposite the shower head seemed to keep it from disappearing quicker than I was using it.It seemed to last about a month. My skin was pretty much the same as using old spice so I didn’t see a huge benefit other than the better feeling I’m using all natural soap rather than something that comes in a bottle. I think I’ll keep trying for another option since this was 10$ and lasted a month, and I really don’t want to spend 120$ a year on soap.\n",
            "I've bought a lot of Pine Tar scent over the years. It used to be my favorite Dr. Squatch scent. However, something has changed. Either the process to manufacturer or ingredients have changed for the worse recently. The old bars from last year were great, smooth, luxurious, and long lasting. This year, the bars start crumbling after a few showers. More of the soap has gone down the drain than on my body. And I've noticed the same issue in other scents recently too. I complained to Dr. Squatch and they sent me another bar. Excellent customer service. However, it was the same stuff, different day. I also noticed a change in packaging. The old, good bars used to have a white label/band around it. The new junk doesn't have the white labels, it's only in a box. So, beware, what once was a great soap I couldn't shower without, is now crumbly junk that doesn't last like it used to. I'll be looking for another brand of soap.\n",
            "I was very skeptical of the price point...why purchase one bar of soap when I can have 32 oz's of my trusted body wash that i've been using for 16 years. Then I thought to myself, \"i've been using the same body wash for 16 years?\" One morning after i've showered with my body wash I became disgusted with the scent. I no longer want to smell like a teenager, and here come the ads of Dr. Sasquatch on my Instagram feed. So i gave it a try, and the first product i tried was the Cedar Citrus scent. After day one of use, I instantly became a fan. The scent alone is quite therapeutic, I felt very clean, and most importantly I didn't smell like a pubescent awkwardly shy freshman.I was very disappointed that my bar of soap was gone within a week in a half after reading reviews of how to carefully store the soap when not in use; however, I will never use liquid soap on my body ever again. My skin feels rejuvenated after using this product. I then bought a 5 pack of in which I am writing a review about. Once done with all 5 I will write a follow up review of which scent made the biggest impression. So far Pine Tar, the flagship scent, has been great.THANK YOU DR. SASQUATCH FOR EXISTING!!! YOU HAVE MADE ME A CUSTOMER FOR LIFE!\n",
            "I read many reviews before purchasing this product. I took their advice and cut my bar into 4 quarters. I also bought a draining soap dish to keep the soap out of water as I hear it disintegrates quickly when left in water. I just finished my first quarter after 11 showers but I don’t think I’ll use the other 3 at all. I tried it but I didn’t like it.I purchased PineTar per everyone’s recommendation. It has a scent but it’s very minimal, even after lathering up. Smells like a forest but only barely.The biggest thing I didn’t like is how I felt after my showers. I felt like a wax doll covered in dry soap. I don’t like that and I’m not used to that.Another thing I didn’t like is a few hours after my shower, I could begin to smell myself, not good smells. My normal soaps never did that.I’m used to using Axe Phoenix shower gel. I will be switching back to this. It smells way better and leaves me feeling fresh and clean every time. I also smell great all day as well.I see so many ads from Dr. Squatch competing shower gel. I guess I’m on Team Shower Gel now.\n",
            "I've had this soap for 1 week now and do think it is great and you do get what you pay for in a more expensive soap.Not really a pro/con but an observation.  The smell the bar has doesn't linger that long after the shower.  However, I kept getting wafts of a smell while at work this week and it took me a few days to place it.  It smells like dried hay that got a little wet.  It is not unpleasant, as that is a sweet musky smell.  If you work around animals, you know that smell and it isn't bad.  Just know you probably won't smell like pine but more like hay.  Maybe that is your thing and in that case, it is great!Pros: good lather, not drying, and feels great!Cons: As most have already put, it dissolves quick despite all efforts.  I cut it in half with dental floss and used a woven soap bag so it would hang and dry between showers too.  I'm through the first half in just under a week.  So, yeah, they don't last too long and if you are OK with going through $20-30 in bar soap in a month then go for it.  It is a quality natural product so this is to be expected to a degree but oof, that's fast.I'm going to finish off this bar then go through the Bay Rum one I got as well.  Going to try Duke Cannon next to see where I land.\n",
            "So. I wanted to like this. I love a good pine tar soap and unfortunately I can’t call it that.  So most natural soap people either love or hate pine tar soap. And that usually has something to do with the smell.  I personally love it !!  A strong pine tar will smell like you cut down pine trees in the middle of a forest fire, or what I would call.. a man.  This pine tar doesn’t even smell like pine tar.  It’s weak at best. It almost has a perfume aroma.  This soap also has some very hard worked into it. I don’t know what it is? Almost like a small wood chip or something.  But drag it across your chest one time and you won’t do it again. The other two in the 3 pack smelled nice but it was the pine tar I really wanted to try.  If you want a strong pine tar go with The Healthy Porcupine. Hope this helps.\n"

            "It's alright, not amazing, commercials are great but only wish soap lived up to the hype.Received it on june 19, and followed all recommendations, cut it in squares and kept it away from running water and it lasted a good 20 days, showering twice a day which is not bad for a single soap bar in my opinion.Scrubbing felt good due to the sand and oats but left my skin dry after showering and the sent only lasted minutes.Trying a different variation as this one in particular (Pine Tar) was average to me.\n",
            "I loved how the soap cleans. It gets all the gunk off and the abolishes the funk like nothing I've ever used before. I especially appreciate how when I wash my beard and hair with it, it doesn't strip all the oils from them.My biggest gripe is that it doesn't last long. I paid ten dollars for a bar of soap. I expect it to last. Like... a long time. I can't imagine adjusting my personal hygiene budget by an additional fifty dollars a month JUST for soap. Perhaps if they dropped the price of a bar by a few bucks, I'd be more inclined.Lastly, I don't really like the inclusion of organic matter (i.e. pine needles) in the bar of soap. The volume taken up by the needles is volume they could have used to include more soap though I am sure they're keenly aware of this.Overall, great product. But, like most fancy pants hygiene products, it's way overpriced. I don't know of many \"real men\" that would pay ten bucks for a bar of soap on the regular. I know plenty of hipster \"men\" that would, though. I think they used to call them metrosexuals?If you're rich and like quality soap, this is for you :D If you're a blue collar working man who lives paycheck to paycheck, then this is probably going to be a one-off luxury item you'll try and never purchase again.\n",
            "meh. Overpriced, hard to use, not great not even good. Please please people don’t buy into the idea that all other soap is bad and this product will save your life. This soap melts away in water, you must dry it off immediately after using, is scratchy like pumice, and well, you can get ten bars of soap for the same price. Honestly, tired of slick marketing saying women will fall for you based on how this smells (no discernible difference with the ladies). I tried it on Amazon rather than getting a soapscription (hardy har har) direct. That was a good call.I just use a soap sponge and body wash. Much better at moisturizing and hitting all the sweet spots.\n",
            "I will never purchase from this vendor again. Not at these prices. The bar when I received it was not much larger than a Neutrogena bar and only slightly wider. I was very underwhelmed. The commercials make this bar seem like it's HUGE and will last a lifetime and that you are spending $13 for a massive product when IMO you are not.I do however confess, the scent of this bar is as advertised and out of this world!!!I have found another product twice the size and half the price.\n",
            "This soap is horrible! I bought this for my husband because he loves the outdoors. When it arrived so.ething smelled off but I had ordered multiple things so I wasn't sure what was causing the smell. After a day, it's mildewy aroma filled out home and we sniffed around every room to locate what the horrible smell was! That night, when my husband tried to use it he realized exactly what the smell was and it left a dry red rash on his skin. Please do not buy!\n",
            "To be honest, the only  difference I noticed was in my wallet. My skin felt the same, the scent was barely noticeable, and it left black residue in my shower. The worse part was that the bar lasted 3 weeks, and that included a 3 day weekend I spent at a hotel in which I didn’t use it. I even had the experience wood soap tray, it didn’t help at all.Sorry, but for the amount that this soap costs, it should last a lot longer. Going back to regular old soap, never trust hipsters selling soap.\n",
            "I purchased two bars of the Pine Tar soap.  The first bar had a much stronger pine smell to it.  I tried it and immediately threw it out after because the soap left me smelling like Pine-sol the rest of the day!  The second bar seemed to have a normal level of scent.  After two weeks I had to stop using it because the exfoliants used in the soap are rougher than 120 grit sandpaper.  The exfoliants caused my skin to turn pink from irritation!  I switched back to another bar of soap and the pink color of my skin went away.  My skin also dried out from using the Dr. Squatch soap, which is opposite of what they advertise.  Overall, you are paying 2-3 times more for this soap even though the quality is inconsistent.\n",
            "This is my first time using a Dr. Squatch product. I decided to give their soap for men a try after being bombarded with their ads over the past few weeks. Overall it is a good soap. I've felt refreshed and clean after using their Pine Tar scented bar but it doesn't look like I'll be able to get many more uses as the bar is already almost gone.After only 4 showers it is getting small. But as I said it does do the job. With the \"Heavy Grit\" the Pine Tar has you'll feel the exfoliation when going bar to skin and you won't feel dried out after either. I would recommend getting the bar out of reach of water when not using it. Not only to extend the life of the bar but in the case of the Pine Tar bar it will leave a black run off in the tub.All in all it is a good product and I do want to try other scents but I will have to consider the price and how quickly the bar lasts before I decide to make Dr. Squatch my go to soap from here on out.\n",
            "I have tried two of the bars so far. I had heard that bay rum was the best smelling soap, but when I smelled all of the scents, it was my least favorite, so I used it first. The scent actually stays around after drying which is a pleasant surprise. I probably wont was my body with the bay rum again, but I'll use it as hand soap. The gold moss is the other one I have tried and it smells much better to my nose. The rest smell even better. They actually do sort of moisturize which to me at this point in winter is pretty important since it's so dry here. Overall, I'm quite impressed. Good job the soap guy! .... I mean, Dr. Squatch! Lol (still dont understand why there is controversy there... that's how businesses work)\n",
            "I bought this soap along with other scents as gifts this year for a few fellows.The pine tar seems to be both my dad's and my husband's favorite bar so far.They love the smell, they like the exfoliation aspect, they like that it's more moisturizing than their usual big brand soaps.My husband's winter rashes from work coats constantly rubbing on his skin aren't nearly as band or bothersome this year. I imagine that's due to the extra moisture content in the soap.All in all, they're both pretty happy with their soap.Down side, my husband said he liked seeing how much dirt came off him in the suds. But the black soap masks that with its black colored suds. Haha.\n",

            "Here's the thing, YouTube is riddled with advertisement with this company and at the same time I've been looking to replace my store bought soaps and body wash. There are several different companies like Dr. Squatch, but I chose to start things off with them because of ads and reviews.I started things off with Pine Tar and it does smell great and the packaging is nice! Not as strong of a scent like the ads would imply buy it smells good regardless. I've been using it a week now and since this is a five once bar, it's a decent size for me and on my showering routine it should last another two weeks so that's three weeks total. It really all depends on the individual in which the bar dissapates. It does provide a great lather  and again the smell is terrific but I must say, after the shower, the smell is not strong. At least not for me. I do feel and smell clean but not loud in aroma. I'm perfectly fine with that seeing that I use cologne and cocoa butter in my cleaning process. I don't need a very potent smell with those mentions. It would be overwhelming. Another thing for me is that it doesn't leave my skin dry. I use less lotion because of this so points for them in the creation of this.I subscribed to six bars every quarter so I will update my thoughts and experiences on the other fragrances.I will say that given the subscription which makes each bar around six bucks per bar is on the pricey side but for me, I'm fine with that expense seeing that I don't plan on going back to over the counter detergent. My skin is sold on natural and I don't think there is no going back!\n",
            "Seriously, I mean it’s not a bad thing but like, my hubby loves this soap!!! I didn’t think he would care for it much......since he was using the less scented chemical ridden old spice that smelled like wannabe little teens that think 20 sprays of Cologne is going to fix their personalities....wait I got off track. So this soap really has a strong smell but it’s a GREAT smell!!! They don’t lie it really does leave you skin smooth but with a manly smell, yea....you got it in your cart right?? Get it in your cart!!! It smells great! ALSO my husband got the 10 pk and couldn’t for the life of him choose which one he liked better, so it’s great that there is a variety! Totally worth it!\n",
            "This soap does smell pretty good.  I’ve been using natural soaps for a long time, and these are good quality.As many mentioned, this soap is really soft.  Definitely buy a wooden drainer (I found 2 cedar drainers for 10 bucks on Amazon).  This soap essentially melts if left in a regular soap dish, the whole bar will be gone in a week, that’s why the drainer is important, and keep it in a place where the water won’t hit it.  I also took another reviewers recommendation and cut them into fourths.  If I hadn’t done this, I would be bummed.  However, because because I took these precautions, I’m fairly stoked.The moss smells the best, but isn’t as scrubby.  The pine tar is scrubby, but doesn’t smell as good, still nice though.  The orange sandalwood is decent, I’m not a huge fan of citrus soaps, but if you are, it’s a nice one (my wife likes it for herself).  Overall, this soap is pretty good, but requires some work if you don’t want to feel ripped off.  Jury’s out on whether I’ll purchase in the future, not positive it’s worth ten bucks a bar.\n",
            "So first off the scents are pretty nice. So far I've only tried Cedar Citrus and Pine Tar, but they both smell very good. The lather is a little disappointing. I use the axe scrubber/detailer and i found myself having to lather it about 3 or 4 times in the shower. Definitely wears the soap down. I have a generic wooden soap saver and so far it seems like the bars only last about 1 1/2 to 2 weeks. My duke cannon bar soap lasts about a month and a half. Granted, those bars are twice as big as dr squatch, but for the price, i feel like Dr Squatch needs to work on making their soap last longer. I'll still buy from them, but just don't expect the bars to last long.\n",
            "Listen. This soap smells great and is amazing when it comes to lather. I’ll say the exfoliation may be a bit aggressive for some, but for me was perfect. My only gripe and reason for the 2 stars? It’s lasted about 6 showers. Literally couldn’t get through a whole week. If it was cheaper I wouldn’t care, but 10 bills for 6 showers is a bit steep. That’s 50 dollars a month just for soap!I will say though, I’d keep a bar in the shower just to get the smell. It’s that strong and pleasant. I can smell it when my wife showers and she’s not even using it. It’s like the steam in the room activates it.If the price doesn’t bother you it’s easily the best soap I’ve encountered. I just can’t get past the life span.\n",
            "I have sensitive skin and eczema on top of that, so I have been using natural soaps for as long as I can remember. I was hesitant to pull the trigger on this stuff being that it seems to be very showy with all the advertisements on YouTube and other websites, it just seemed like a lot of hoopla for something that can’t be any better than what I’ve already been using. Well, I was right. It’s not bad soap. It’s just nothing special. Certainly not worth $10 a bar. I suppose if you’re coming from some big brand name body wash or something similar, this may seem like a totally different experience. I understand that. But believe me, you can find much better products for much less moolah. Just search natural men’s soap on here or visit your local holistic store.\n",
            "Pros: + High Quality Product  + American Made  + Subtle, not overpowering fragrance  + Natural exfoliationCons: - Price point vs How long the product lasts. You can easily have a $3-4 a week soap habit.( I think the reason why this soap doesn't last long is because, you'll want any and every excuse to use this product. )It's a high quality product at a high quality price point.The Pine Tar Bar contains oatmeal and sand, to help with exfoliation. I personally like the rough eraser feeling from using the soap.The smell from this product is refreshing. Smelling natural, not strong or artificial. You can tell a difference after use but, it doesn't overwhelm your senses. It's subtle and I dig that.I've since gone to their website and purchase an additional $40 worth of soap and a sample of their cologne.Final Word: If you're curious, I recommend trying this product via Amazon. If you like it, check out their website and purchase it at a reduced rate.If you've drank the kool-aid like me, you can actually start a soap subscription with various price levels and options.\n",
            "Smells great, feels great, awesome for sensitive skin.Downside is been using mine sparingly for 6 day’s straight and i would say you’ll maybe get 2 week’s outta one bar, which for the price of $10 is not good. I’d prefer to buy one of my kid’s a Funko fnaf plush for that price point. Back to the topic the Pin star smells really great for me personally and my wife and kid’s love the nautical sage.Would I buy again, yes because it’s different and smells great then using the alternative soap like something off the shelf at Walmart, but again for 2 week’s use is really going to hurt the wallet and question my future investment in the soap.\n",
            "Good scent.  Last long if you couple this with soap saver like “ Frcolor 10pcs exfoliating mesh soap saver pouch sack sponge “that you can hang instead of placing in soap dish.  The problem with soap dish most of the soap will in covered in water.  With the sacks, it keeps the soap together while hanging and at the same time keeps the soap together.  That should save most of the issue people have with the soap breaking up so fast.  I have the soap for 3 weeks and I take shower everyday.  And occasionally twice.  I do feel a little dry when stepping out of the shower and finding myself having to put lotion on.  But other than that good soap.\n",
            "One star due to longevity of product and not being worth the cost.IF you are looking for a great bar of soap that lasts about a week, this is the one for you!  The fragrance and moisturizing effects were very good but what started out out as a healthy $9 bar of soap quickly dissipated into a sliver over the course of the week.To be clear, in between showers I kept the soap out of the shower and in a very dry place.  I saw one of the leading reviews here go into elaborate details about cutting the soap into quarters using fishing line and applying it with a boars hair brush and storing it in some intricate soap dish of. bamboo and rubber — that is lunacy.  All that for a bar of soap that should be able to withstand more than one weeks worth of showering.At the end of the day, or shower as it is, all of the hip and alluring marketing from Dr Squatch cannot gloss over the fact that a $9 bar of soap, stored properly in between showers, only lasts one week.  There are many other options that are just as good and less expensive—go find one!\n"

            "Having seen all the ads and commercials highlighting how great these soaps smell, I decided to take the plunge and get a variety pack and see what the fuss was all about.The soaps are not very good at all. The 3 flavors all smelled the same. To add to this, they all have this heavy patchouli smell, like an old-man perfumey smell that is just not good. 85% of the smell of the soaps are this heavy, “base layer” patchouli smell, and the remaining 15% of the smell is a very weak and almost unnoticeable smell that is the listed flavor of the soap.The soap does not smell on your body after you bathe. You have to scrub and put your nose right up to the suds, and even then you get a palate-full of spiced patchouli smell... the smell FAR from the manly smells advertised on commercials. In fact, without boxes or labels, the soaps seem like something you’d find in an unmarked basket in the back of a HomeGoods listed as “natural soaps” that most patrons pass by, despite being listed at a discount. In fact, MOST decorative soaps you buy at  stores offer a deeper smell and more masculine smell than these soaps, which are advertised to be used. I have used this Dove “men care” soap, nothing crazy, and that smells leagues better than this stuff. And the smell stays on your body.I was convinced by the commercials, the names of the soaps sounded delicious, the “affordable” price, the “Made in USA” sticker, etc. This review sucks to write because I wanted to love this soap, and bought it against the advice of some friends who said “it’s probably just soap.” Unfortunately, they were right, and it’s even hard to equate this stuff to soap. No manly smells, the smells don’t stick after you shower, and the weird, uncley floral smell is just abysmal.I’m sorry Dr. Squatch, I tried. I WANTED to love you, but man I just don’t know how these soaps are so disconnected from what I saw in the ads and commercials. :(\n",
            "So right out the box there’s a strong Pine odor, which I thought was cool cause then maybe this bar really helps keep the scent on you, but no it doesn’t.Secondly I bought this cause it was advertised as a natural soap, it’s far from it, lathering it on my chest felt like I was breathing into a bucket of Pine Soil cleaner, lathering my neck I could fell my eyes getting irritated.Lastly this thing leaves a black residue all over your shower.Oh and the scent last about as long as a regular bar of soap, without the high price.The commercials are cool tho.\n",
            "Read quite a few reviews on this product before purchasing. Many say the bars won't last long. I shower daily and am still using the first bar I opened in the three pack (2 weeks and 1 day ago to be exact), and still have quite a bit of that bar left. I keep my soap on a soap dish on a shelf outside the shower when not in use, and I will use a washcloth or loofah sometimes. I don't understand how these people are going thru this soap so fast. 1 week? I have at least another week or 2 left on the bar I am using. And they lather up like crazy. I feel they do a good job. I have no regrets using this in place of my Dove mens soap. The picture I took is the bar after exactly 2 weeks of use, and as you can see it's not nearly as bad as some reviews. Not that other reviews are bad, I just have no idea how they are using this soap up so fast, other than maybe they are leaving it in the shower under running water. If you simply avoid that this soap will last a very long time.\n",
            "This soap smells great, but the fragrance is not nearly as heavy on the skin.  So don't expect anything unusual in that department.  The soap dissolves much faster than name brand bars like Dove or Irish Spring and when it gets thinner pieces of the black soap break off all over you.  Also do not use white wash cloths as they will be turned black by the soap and need very thorough rinsing/washing to get them white again.  It's also a relatively soft soap and breaks apart easily.  I didn't much care for it and at that price expected more.  With that said - it does make your bathroom smell good just sitting the soap dish.\n",
            "I really like this soap. The texture is good, the smell is great, and it leaves you really feeling clean. The only problem is that it lasted only five days. Ten dollars for soap that lasts that long is not a good deal, your money is better spent purchasing basic soap and a scrubbing cloth. I stored it in a dry dish, I didn’t use it more than a regular amount once per day, and i didn’t stand under the water while applying it. Just FYI for those who say everything is being used wrong.\n",
            "UPDATE:The soap dwindles down really quickly.  At first it doesn't, but when you get to the mid-point, it starts becoming soft and not nicely spreadable on a loufah. NOTE: Don't put this soap in a soap box and try to put it on a non-stick surface if you can.  The scent is still good, but it isn't turning out to be the replacement soap i want.ORIGINAL:I wasn't one to spend more than $10 on a bar of soap until I received one for a birthday present.  I was a very regular customer for Mistral Men's Soap which offered many different scents.  These soaps were really great and they would last a long time.  However, it seems like they are no longer selling through Amazon and I was having a hard time locating a functioning website.  I then embarked on my journey for a new soap.  I was considering moving back to the traditional bar soap sold at retail stores.  however, the Dr. Squatch box captured  my attention.  I read the reviews and they all were mostly positive.  I've used the soap already 5 times via a loufa and it hasn't dwindled down like other soaps.  Also I think it does a greater job cleaning while not leaving a strong manly pine forest scent; it's the right amount.  I'm going to revisit this review if the soap doesn't live up to my expectations, but so far, it's been great.  Plus it's easy on the skin.\n",
            "A stop at my local T.J.m store I found much larger bars of better smelling men's soap for way less in fact 1/3 of the price. The value is not there at all unless you very much need a package with a big foot on it. Yes, for what they are charging for 1 small bar they need to give you 3 bars because the market is crowded now with competitors selling high quality, natural ingredients etc, etc etc soaps, they are everywhere now not a boutique item at all. I was looking for something with super quality very unique and special but the only thing remotely unique about this soap is the package that goes straight in the garbage.\n",
            "If you're buying this product thinking it's going to smell like your typical men's soaps like Old Spice or Gilette, then this isn't the soap for you. In all honesty, I was a little disappointed in, not only the smell, but by how expensive this product was given the fact that it didn't even last too long. Yes, it did smell like an all-natural, \"foresty-scented\" soap, but it left a bad after-smell in my shower. If you like that \"essential, all-natural oil smell,\" then that's great, but if you don't, then avoid this product. On the positive side, it left my skin feeling moisturized, so if you have dry skin, this soap may help, but if you have sensitive skin, this is not the soap to get since it does have rough particles in it! Lastly, DO NOT leave this soap out by itself, for it will leave a black streak in your shower. Put it in a soap container (if it fits since it's square...weird), or at least a plastic bag. Good luck, shoppers!\n",
            "Hate to give this soap a bad review, as I don't doubt the quality of the ingredients.  Nor can I speak to the durability of a single bar, since I only used my first bar 3x.  The ad was so good, and I have long used good natural Castile soap anyway, that I couldn't help but throw a little business Dr. Squatch's way.But having some significant environmental allergies, my choice of Cedar Citrus was maybe not a great idea.  This stuff left my skin incredibly dry and pretty itchy, it took a lot of Shea butter to get my skin to stretch back out again.  I don't hold that against Dr. Squatch and maybe its even a testament to how natural the soap is.  Perhaps I'll try the pine tar soap someday, as I remember using it as a kid, but I gotta stick with my usual Castile soap otherwise.\n",
            "I’ve been using this soap twice a day for 10 days now. I bought this soap because the commercial said or implied that the user of this soap would not have to use anymore deodorant, what? Yes. I thought $10 for one bar of soap that is a bit much, but If using this soap will do away with the use of deodorant it definitely would be worth the $10.  Well, it’s just a bar of soap an expensive bar of soap at that. When my wife said, wow! Put your arms down and I wasn’t even sweating I knew the claims made about this soap was bogus. The soap itself smells like pine-sol and after awhile I couldn’t stand it. Not worth the money.👎🏼\n"

            "For all those reviews complaining about the runny trails down the white showers let me tell ya, you have to be smarter then a bar of soap -.-  I love this stuff, smells amazing, washes amazing, yes it will streak down your white shower walls (or any other color really) but that's the nature of a natural pin TAR soap it's in the name!  Guess what?! Put it in a travel soap box and BAM no more mess -imagine that! As for value for the price bought it mid November running out mid December  10$ a month for 1 bar of soap (I Don't Think So) Lil Rich for my blood, every once in a while I sure will treat myself!\n",
            "The infamous bar soap, a fan favorite! I wanted a clean soap, no toxic chemicals..the whole \"veganish\" experience. This product is advertised everywhere and the commercials are very entertaining. I give it a solid 3, $10 bar soap is expensive. I purchased pine tar and it smells like Comet bathroom cleaner and the bar itself is on the small side. on a positive note the lather is great, leaves skin feeling soft, and the bathroom smells great after 30 minutes lol. it also doesn't \"melt\" during hot showers. I would give it another try but definitely a different scent. 2nd score 3.3\n",
            "Honest review. I really like the soap. The funny ads actually made me want to try it out. Pretty pricey for soap I thought but what the heck, I’ll try it out. Smelled awesome, I opened the pine tar and within minutes my whole bathroom smelled like it. Works great, I have dry skin that a after a couple days pretty much went away. BUT.... this stuff melts away like snow on a 90 degree day. I put my bar in an airtight container to try to keep it dry, but it still barely made it past 2 weeks for a bar. I honestly didn’t expect that, and with the price being 8 bucks a bar basically, it’s just not very economical.\n",
            "Probably the best soap I’ve used and Pine Tar is the best scent in my opinion. My only complaint is the price. $10 for a single bar of soap is a little steep especially for how long it lasts. You’ll definitely want to keep it away from any drips or spray or it’ll be gone before you know it (but that’s any bar of soap for you). If you use it every day you might get dry itchy skin, but I think any soap will do that with daily use. So really other than the price, I have no real complaints about this. I’ve bought it again several times because I liked it so much as will probably continue to do so from time to time\n",
            "Horrendous customer and product support. The picture attached here is of the soap that was used four times and then sat for 22 days while I went on a business trip. No one use the soap, nor use the bathroom that the soap was in. The soap was placed on a soap saver. In conclusion the soap literally shrunk without being used. I tried their customer service department and got the run-around. For a $10 soap, I was very unpleased. Additionally the representative said that their soaps are only designed to last about 14 days.\n",
            "Confused. \"About what?\" you might be asking yourself. Well, I ordered the \"Nautical Sage\" scent. As you can see from my attached photo, that is not the scent I received. I ended up receiving a scent called \"Alpine Sage\" (which admittedly does smell pretty great so I'm not going to raise hell over it). The thing that has me sort of puzzled, is that I have never seen or heard of this scent they sent me. To my knowledge, it's never been advertised in any of their many silly Instagram Ads, nor is it listed as a scent you can purchase from Amazon. It is my personal theory that many people ordered \"Nautical Sage\" and complained that it smells more like a mountain than an ocean, so they fixed the product label and never made the official changes otherwise. All that being said, this soap is pretty good. It smells great, and leaves your skin feeling very clean, and the bar is so buttery smooth you just want to take a bite out of it. I've seen many complaints online about the scent being short-lived. This is true. You won't really smell like the scent for very long after your shower. But does that really matter? After you put on deodorant, aftershave, cologne, and (maybe) hair product, do you really need to smell like your soap all day? Men use so many products that have their own scents and fragrances, that by the time you step out the door and head to work it's not your soap that you hope people smell and compliment - it's everything else! One more thing needs to be said, and I really hope that the good people at Dr. Squatch read this and take it to heart... the bars NEED TO BE MADE LARGER. This soap is probably the least economical soap you are going to find on the market. $10 a bar is fair, but not for how long these bars last. I've showered only twice now since receiving my soap, and I can already tell that it probably won't last longer than two weeks TOPS. Which means I should probably be preemptive in my next order. Don't get me wrong, I'm going to order more - it's still good soap. But I can promise you that if I don't see an increase in the size of the bar in my next few orders, I will be moving on to search for another natural soap to use. It seems that if I want to use this soap long term, and without increase in soap quantity, I will have to adapt myself to \"poor stay poor\" economics.\n",
            "I love the scent.  Natural soap will dry faster and cause 'shrinkage' with the bar (George Castanza voice), so the comments that might turn one off to this product for that reason isn't a good reason in my opinion.  A bit pricey for soap?  Perhaps, but that is in the eye of the beholder.  I would gladly pay for quality.  I also have some Duke C soap and I do like that, it's a bit more light scented for me.  The Squatch Pine Tar is pretty good, but there is a better one out there (Porcupine) for my taste.  Over all, this was a a great purchase for me and I would happily purchase again, or will be when I have to.\n",
            "The 2 stars is not due to poor product - in fact kind of the exact opposite. It’s to get the manufacturers attention. Mostly regarding the pine tar.Ok so these soaps are amazing - particularly their pine tar, which is exactly the kind of pine tar soap I’ve been looking for for years. It’s pine tarry, but not “just retarred a wooden boat hull for 10 hours and am drenched in pitch” strength. It’s also has some woodsy and citrus companions in there that are perfect. It’s great. HOWEVER- it does not last. I take relatively quick daily showers and this stuff was gone in about a week. Which sucks cuz I love the stuff. I attribute this to the sand or whatever the exfoliating additive in there is. Their other 2 bars (the moss and the citrus ones lasted significantly longer and neither had the exfoliant ingredient) I honestly really liked the exfoliant addition but not at the expense of the longevity of the bar. So my advice to manufacturer would be to lose the sand. You’ve created what I consider basically the perfect soap, don’t lose customers over the exfoliant. I’ll pay $7 a bar if it has the longevity of your other soaps but like another reviewer mentioned, I’m not paying $30 a month for soap, perfect or not.Other 2 soaps ( moss and citrus) were very good. Moss was unique and I really dug it but could maybe be 1/3 or so stronger in scent. Still great stuff.\n",
            "I was being bombarded with ads for this soap and eventually I caved. I decided to try out the original Pine Tar bar. I just got one to try it out. Little pricey. I figured it was probably really nice for that reason. It smelled great. I also liked how it exfoliates your skin. That being said, one bar lasted me about 8-10 showers max. As soon as it gets wet it quickly begins to “melt” or whatever (you know how soap does). Except normal soap usually takes a while to completely widdle down to nothing. Not the Squatch! Pretty clear waste of money.I would give it 2 stars Bc I liked the smell and exfoliating, but something is up with these ratings. There’s no way this should have 4-5 stars. Something fishy is going on. So I’ll give it one star. I’m sure there are alternative natural soaps that will last you for more than 8 showers. Spend your money elsewhere. They should spend less money on advertising and more on product development. Don’t think I’ll be shopping for any more of their products.\n"

Its incredibly oily so you’ll have a sheen of oil over you after use, its quite small for $9 a bar and much smaller then I thought It would be and will not last more than a week or two. It does clean well but its definitely not worth the money, I wanted something unique and smelly and this is not it.\n",
            "Got this for my boyfriend for his birthday because he wanted to try it.The bar of soap itself smells so strong, strong enough that I knew what it was before opening the bag it came in. After he showered with it, he didn't smell like a quote 'big sexy pine tree like I wanted' and I agree. He didn't really smell like anything, like the smell from didn't exist on his skin at all. His skin does look and feel much more moisturized and that's what really matters.\n",
            "At first I was definitely put off but the price. I bought 1 bar to try it. It was the Bay Rum. While the smell it left on me wasn't great, I noticed  I didn't have to wear any deoderant in between showers. I didn't think much of it after the bar was gone, until I went back to dove soap.  I had to wear deodorant almost immediately.I decided to give it another go and bought this 3 pack. I use it as a \" hot spot\" soap, and use it after my regular soap, to make it last and get the good effects from it. No more need to wear deodorant unless working, etc.  And even then I don't need much. Just goes to show that cheaper soaps really don't cut it. They're more for general purpose.Overall really great product and will buy again.\n",
            "After recieving my shipment, I let my wife smell this wonderful soap. Instantly we were taken back to a time in life where, we didn't have responsibilities, we didn't have a mortgage, kids, bills or any of the other weights the world places on our shoulders. It was just us. A man, a woman and the burning desire to love each other.How does it smell you may ask. That's easy. It smells like a pack of tornados wrecked a pine tree forest, then made a quick stop in Florida, to lightly sprinkle in the finest citrus oils. In short, it smells like, the passion on the forest, the heat of the finest citrus oils, and the desire of a tornado.Purchase this soap if it's the last thing you ever don\n",
            "I was sick of my wifes bar soap and wanted something that smelled masculine ... should of just bought a 8 pack of irish spring. Soap shouldnt cost $10 a bar unless it comes from the Paper Street Soap Co. Anyway when i get it im excited till i see the size. I will say in the shower it smells great buy doesn't lather and left my skin tacky and only lasted 8 days.  I will not buy this or another designer soap again.\n",
            "I love the soap but because of the price and how long it last I’ll never buy again. This is the biggest disappointment. It is so frustrating that I can’t even mention the good stuff about it. I took one shower with it and can agree with every review that states it only last a week. I’d love to continue using it because the quality is amazing but the price vs longevity is a ripoff. I seen the size difference after one shower and can guarantee that it would be a $40-$50/month soap. Back to the soap from HEB\n",
            "My husband received this for Christmas and loves it. He said he’s not going back to regular men’s body wash and we ended up buying a variety three pack. The scent is amazing, but doesn’t last long out of the shower. It is exfoliating, which helps clear out any back acne. It also moisturizes the skin and leaves it soft, which is great because he hates using lotion. He uses the soap every day and it last a little over a month. To make it last longer, I would suggest lathering it directly onto your body and NOT a washcloth.\n",
            "Okay so I’ve read reviews of other customers but went ahead and bought it anyway just to try it out. So first off I love the scent and so does my wife. It for sure moisturizes my skin pretty well for a bar soap. It doesn’t leave your skin feeling super dry after using it like many other bar soaps. Price is a little ridiculous for the amount of soap you get. If it was like $5 a bar I would for sure be a repeat customer. After first use I already noticed how fast the bar Deteriorates. Overall I enjoy the soap. It smells good, doesn’t dry out skin and feels like it has some type of rough exfoliation material in there so it feels like you’re really cleaning your skin. I just wouldn’t buy the product again based off of price alone. $10 a bar that lasts maybe 5-6 showers is ridiculous. The squatch website says most customers use 2 bars a month. Well those customers must shower once every 2-3 days because there is no way 2 bars would last me a month.\n",
            "This soap is nothing more then clever marketing.  I have used the same brand of soap now for years (Dr Bronners). I saw a commercial for this stuff and saw they had different scents then I use.  it sounded a bit expensive, but I figured if it smells good and has few ingredients it may be worth it.  Not even close to worth ten dollars or even three, what I would normally pay for the Dr Bronners.  Where do i even start, this soap is practically scentless.  There is a very vague scent of pine and I mean very vague, it smells more like unscented soap then pine.  Is also extremely small.  Even keeping this dry after a shower, it only lasts maybe a week and a half.  If you are looking for a great scented soap, that has few ingredients and lasts a decent amount of time, this definitely is not the soap you want.\n",
            "Smells great, gets the job done, but it’s cold processed. It’s not supposed to stay in water, as soon as you’re done putting it on your luffa, sponge, or brush, you’re supposed to find a dry spot in your shower, or it’ll just melt away. That’s not mentioned on their box either. Great soap, with sand, oats, etc. just not worth $10 for a single bar. Maybe 2 or 3, but one. Pass. Other companies will give you a box for the same stuff, with more scents, for the same price. Wouldn’t recommend.\n",

            "I get the emissions excuse, and these bars do smell great. I will be returning to duke cannon though after this try. The bars are way too small. Its about the size of a sample bar you'd get in a hotel. Way overpriced for how little you get. A Duke cannon bar is about three times the size and for size/price ratio tremendously a better deal. For a product claiming to be manly, this is the most danty feminine sized bar I habe ever seen. The whold emissions thing is definitely hipster and not manly. Hipsters are not masculine, they are only pretending to be.\n",
            "I never usually take the time to write reviews, but I definitely wanted to express how much I love this soap. I for one used bar soaps only when I was a kid, and then only used body-wash up for years up until now. Every single time after I take a shower, I always have to put on lotion ALL over my body. My skin just gets so dry for some reason after taking a shower. After using this soap once, I didn't have the feeling to use lotion AT ALL. Sooo many soaps/body-washes say that they are moisturizing and that they leave your skin leaving smooth, yet I always felt my skin was dry and needed to put on lotion. Dr. Squatch definitely moisturizes and leaves your skin soft and smooth. It lathers up so nicely. It's a bit pricey I would say for a bar of soap but it was definitely worth for the price. I expected Pine Tar to smell really really good, but it was okay. I will be trying other scents though.\n",
            "You know the saying “you get a lot for your money?” That doesn’t apply here, you get very little product for you hard earned  money. Also the product definitely doesn’t Perform especially at its price point. Don’t be fooled by their over exaggerated commercials for their over priced / over hyped subpar product. There are better alternatives that not only are a better product, they are also cheaper and give you more for your money.Dr. Squatch is nothing more than a gimmick\n",
            "I got the Pine Tar flavor. It smells decent. The soap lathers very well, especially if you use a shower brush etc. Is it expensive for a bar of soap? Yes. Does it last a decent amount of showers? Yes. Unless you are sharing it with others, won't have to replace it after a week. I'm assuming the price point is based on the lack of industrial ingredients, which I like, but at the end of the day it's just a bar of soap, so it would be nice if the price was a little lower. The price point is what is stopping me from making this my forever soap, and instead a once in awhile soap.\n",
            "I'm not too sure about the sensitive skin aspect because I don't have sensitive skin but this is a great soap!!! I don't think it's made for everyday use unless to take short showers/baths. I used one bar everyday starting on a Sunday and that's definitely 1 shower a day but maybe 2 showers on Saturday and the soap was gone by the following Sunday. Oh and it's definitely not \"No more tears!!\" It will definitely burn your eyes if it gets in them.  My favorite is Pine Tar because it has little pieces of grain in them almost like a scrub!!! Overall a great smelling soap which I will continue to purchase.\n",
            "I really wanted to try something different, organic and unlike the standard soaps out there. I’d seen the advertisements for this brand for so long and thought they were fun. So I thought sure I’ll try it. But honestly I was kinda disappointed with it. The smell is strong but fades fast out of the shower. The soap is rough and chunky. My skin is left feeling very dry and almost sticky even after rinsing. And I’ve used it maybe 12 times and the bar is really disappearing. Like I imagine I’ll get another 15 showers or so before it just breaks up into pieces and it’s a goner. I mean yeah sure I don’t expect a bar of soap to last forever but it’s $10 a bar. 25~30ish showers doesn’t seem like a lot for $10. Maybe it’s just not for me or I don’t get it but I wouldn’t buy another.\n",
            "Use it for everyday showering. I figured I would go the chemical free way. All natural ingredients. I even subscribe two getting the product every two months. It does leave my skin smelling good. Sensitive skin I wouldn't recommend, since it has particles grain's that clean and only (assuming) clear your body of dirt and other particles. Upon using product I was really impressed. By the quality and ingredients it would use on the skin. The down side I have the product now for three weeks and it's almost gone. And for 8.95 and not getting another one for two months is pretty disappointing. I contacted the seller only to Receive a generic response on how and why the possibility of the soap running low so fast. I've decided after this I will be canceling the subscription to their soap and only hope they can continue making the product better and if they do I will reconsider getting the product again\n",
            "Right away I noticed that strong clean feel and smell, after a full day I gave myself a sniff and still smelled like soap, never had a soap that gave me that long-lasting clean smell. The initial pine smell is a bit off and isn't my favorite but the after shower smell is pure clean goodness. can't wait to try the other flavors (yes I know they're scents, not flavors).One thing I HATE about this particular block, the soap is black and I use a soap pouch, the black residue drips all over the shower (even trying to drain all the water from the pouch). So I'd recommend, even if you use a soap pouch, get a soap dish to catch all the soapy drippy residue.\n",
            "Love the pine tar out of all the other scents/smells.  It has cleared up my sensitive skin for the most part. They come with some downfalls. They glycerin in these makes them go super quick. I can't get more than a week out of a bar and I out it on a soap saver out of the water. So the other issue they are expensive for going that quick. Also not a fan of the actual store of Dr. squatch as they take forever to ship. I prefer to get them off here, but they run out of the pine tar quick on Amazon. Most do smell amazing though, it's just the small things.\n"

            "I've seen Dr. Squatch ads for a while now. The blonde haired gentleman we all know has me laughing every time. But honestly, the smells are a little lacking. The commercials make it out to seem like the scent is explosive and amazing. I found my bars to be lacking quite a bit. They smell good, don't get me wrong. But the strength of the smell is quite dull. I also get a strange texture on my skin after a shower using these bars which I don't get with liquid body washes.\n",
            "I prefer my men smelling like a fresh pine forest, not surrounded by a cloud of sprayed on whore sauce (you know what I'm talking about). You know those men that seem to think the same soap and spray they used as 14 year old boys somehow makes women weak.News flash, real women like real men. Men with beards or at least a 5 o'clock shadow. Men that smell like nature and this soap does that.The pine scent is fresh and real. The bar itself has exfoliating bits in it to give your skin a radiant and clean look. It's also great for sensitive skin.\n",
            "Was hoping for a dry, woodsy scent. This is sort of sickly sweet with piney undertones. I could live with that.I realize it's BLACK soap, but my wife is ticked off because I'm spraying black soap suds everywhere. And I'm putting the bar onto a soap rack to dry out between showers, but it's dripping all over the place and making a mess.Finally, the bar is packed with oatmeal. I like a little exfoilation, but this is a bit much. It's like whole shards of dried oatmeal. I'm trying to rub my shaved head with this and I'm literally scratching myself up.No thanks.\n",
            "My husband is a huge fan of these soaps. We have purchased several times. Our only complaint (hence the subtracted star) is that they only last about a week per bar, if that. We are normal everyday people who take normal everyday showers. The soap wasn’t used in excess and wasn’t stored in a place to be melted by the water. This soap is simply used up at a rapid rate. My husband has sensitive skin (he is the only one using this soap) and this doesn’t bother him and he loves the scents, so we continue to buy. Just wanted others to be aware.\n",
            "This soap didn't even last me a week. As expensive this bar a soap is I was thinking this is going to be great it will last me a good amount of time and I will enjoy the new experiment. Boy was I wrong... I spent about $10 dollars for a bar of soap and it only lasted me like 5 days at max. (that's me being nice) my wife was super upset I spent this much on a bar of soap, and I told her honey \"you always get what you pay for\" this is gonna last me long and I will feel great after each shower. I kid you not this soap melts so fast. I bet the cost of this is probably .60-.75 cents at max and this is how much they are charging for a bar of soap. I used Dove soap and it cost me $8.94 with tax and it was a pack of 8. I paid more for 1 bar of Dr. Squatch and didn't even last long. Hell my Dove bar has lasted long. Take my advise Don't pay this much for a soap bar. NOT WORTH IT.. Sorry Dr. Squatch company but I put my faith in your new company with this over priced soap that lasted me 5 days. VERY UPSET.Yours Truly,Unhappy Customer\n",
            "The pine tar smelled reslly good, after using it the first time it would make my whole bathroom and spill out of the BR smell like pine tar, i didnt mind cuz it smells great. Only problem is if you use those like any other bar soap it will last About roughly 2 amd half weeks (18 - 20 days) if youre lucky. I think the way to go is break it up in 2 halves or maybe 4 quarters would be best, the smell lasts like maybe 3 hours, fades very fast. The spices or whatever they put in was rough on my skin the first time, but after that made it feel smooth and no roughness whatsoever! Not worth the 5$ a week soap,  but split up into halves or quarters so make it worth 10$ a month....\n",
            "Absolutely fantastic smell! It is a bit expensive for one bar, but i have had it for about 3 weeks now, showering every other day and it is about half gone, so decent longevity out of it! I did find it is a bit abrasive so maybe not the best soap if you have sensitive skin, but i find it really helps to feel clean when you can feel it scrubbing.My skin is soft for DAYS after using this! and honestly if you go to the dr.squatch website you can get a really good deal on 3 bars or a package of their other products which i will be trying soon!I want to try the duke cannon next, so we will see how they compare but i feel like this is going to be hard to beat.\n",
            "After hearing a raving review from a friend I bought this soap to try it out. I was left feeling empty and scentless. First off this soap left no scent on my body after using it. I used about 1/4-1/2 of the entire bar the first time I washed with it. For how much this soap costs I’d like to get more than a few uses out of it. After rinsing the soap off my skin felt coated and sticky. Water beaded on my body like I had been coated with rain-x. My girlfriend tried it over and area where she had eczema and it made her breakout worse. The only good thing I will say about this soap is that my skin was soft after drying off. Overall not satisfied and will not purchase again\n",
            "The difference between this and regular name brand soaps, is amazing. My skin feels cleaner, smoother, my hair has more body.I wish I had purchased it sooner. My reservation, what are people doing with this soap that it “doesn’t last very long”? If they are rubbing the bar all over their body as they shower what do they expect?I place the bar in a wet wash cloth, sponge, poofy thing, whatever.... give it three or four scrubs because it will quickly lather up, then wash myself. It’s worth trying at least once, I’m hooked....\n",
            "I saw the ads on Facebook, and being a sucker for a good soap (soap, razors, and shaving cream are the three things I never, ever skimp on), I decided to give it a go and try. I wasn’t disappointed at all.I honestly wasn’t sure what to expect, because I’ve never used a pine tar soap before. Obviously I expected it to smell like pine, but aside from that, I honestly had no idea what to expect.I have to say, this is in the list of top soaps I’ve ever used. I’ve been using Harry’s bar for a few years now (and still will, simply because I love that smell), and I’ve been hesitant to try anything new. After using this stuff, though, it’s safe to say that I will be rotating between my usually Harry’s bar and this.It has a feel to it that makes it truly feel like you’re scrubbing the day away. The smell is strong, very strong. But it doesn’t stick with you too heavily— just enough, after you rinse off. I can’t get over how good it feels to scrub with this stuff!!I usually use a washcloth or loofah, but I recommend using this directly bar to skin.Definitely can’t wait to try the other scents!!\n",

            "Writing this review on behalf of my bf who just used the Pine Tar one for the first time. Soap smells good. A little strong at first, but it grows on you. Next thing - and I can’t stress this enough - rubbing the bar of soap directly on your skin is not recommended unless you’ve grown up in a forest or something. I tried warning my bf that “rubbing an exfoliating soap bar directly on your generally sensitive skin is a bad idea” but was mostly ignored because he “wanted the full experience”. Silly me - what do I know? Welp post-shower he has little red circle scrub mark scratches all over his arms and chest area. Part of me feels bad, the other part of me is rolling laughing. Moral to the story? Soap seems legit but don’t say I didn’t warn you if you scrub yourself with it and come out of the shower looking like you got in a fight with a cat.\n",
            "I am conflicted about this soap. On one hand, I really like the smell. On the other hand, the bar fell apart within 4 showers. I shower an average of 5 times a week, sometimes 7 times. This soap contains hard, sharp edges. If you have sensitive skin, this is not the soap for you. If you bathe or shower a lot, this is not the soap for you.The bar is not particularly large, and almost immediately begins to degrade upon contact with water. I also noticed an awful lot of extraneous, tiny objects within the bar. These objects were hard and sharp. Not a fantastic experience.\n",
            "The value is no where near the cost. I got 7-9 showers out of this one bar and that’s it. It also has a bunch of pieces in it that scratch the crap out of you, so no your balls won’t thank you for using this on them.The smell is pretty strong out of the box but out of the shower it’s very light and my wife had a hard time smelling it unless she was very close. It also leaves thick black soap scum everywhere ( I got the pine )Overall I will not be a customer again. $40 a month on soap that scratches you and has a light scent isn’t worth it.\n",
            "I have to say that the quality of the soap is very good.  The bar is well made and appealing to look at.  The lather of the soap varies from dark grey to white (the use of a washcloth is white).  The sent is quite strong, but I really like it.I bought the soap after speaking to a Dr Squatch customer service representative to help with my eczema and other sensitive skin issues.  My problem is that the exfoliating material is very aggressive and I found it to be painful on my eczema.  To get around this I use the soap on a washcloth and apply in that manor avoiding the exfoliating material.  While this is performing as stated it does not meet my uses.  If you would like an aggressive exfoliant you will probably love this bar.due to my skin conditions I would probably not purchase again.\n",
            "This will be the most genuine review of any product I’ve ever given because this stuff is ALMOST great.Let me start with the great. It makes your bathroom smell like Jesus’ personal pine forest. (pine tar)  It’s glorious. The sand and straight up rocks actually scratching me was wonderful. I literally have scratch marks but that’s good. (I do push quite hard, messy job) The rocks rock. Sorry not sorry. The feel is like Mother Theresa’s own butter recipe but once rinsed it’s like an oil free- just washed my body with mean green kinda clean. The clay is a great touch.Ok enough here’s the really bad.10 bucks for a half sized bar of soap that deteriorates 10x faster than that of a regular, say, Dove bar and busts up once you’re about halfway done with it.I understand because of that natural product that there are some things that just cannot be the same. But the good does not justify the bad enough for me to go even 50/50.Initially it is one of the best products I’ve ever used and I am a hygiene freak. Totally phenomenal and I will occasionally buy more. But it just isn’t worth the price. Unless I bought from an overpriced stock but I did not think I did.Anyway hope you enjoy the longest soap review in the history of soap reviews.Cheers to a half damn good product. I know soon it’ll be better and perfected and this company will go far.\n",
            "Love the scent, had no issues with getting a rash but what I do have issues with is how long a bar lasts. Only 9 washes and it was gone. Awefully expensive soap to not last very long. You can literally see it melt away when you use it  I switched to the Oliver Rocket brand off Amazon, and I am much more impressed with it. Same smell, lasts longer,larger bar, and costs 1/2 of what this stuff does. Skip this and opt for the Oliver Rocket pine tar in 3 pack. No thanks needed You're welcome.\n",
            "I was doing it all wrong. As a previous body detergent buying wife for her hubs this soap is great. Always wanted to try it and omg thank Amazon and Squatch to my hubs I did! Found out us Mrs. can use it too! Who knew!? The scents are so amazing I just love them. Hubby won’t be getting rid of me anytime soon now that his body smells like heavenly nature. I may never buy body detergent again and who needs a hubby now that I have Squatch???..........future Mrs. Squatch\n",
            "Honest review of Dr Squatch Pine Tar!I got roped into great advertising and social media posts...marketing is fantastic for this brand. I was excited to get a hold of it!First impression was the the soap smelled great and the texture was nice.  During the shower, I just used the soap without a washcloth. The shower smelled great...as did the bathroom!After about an hour, I noticed that my skin was kind of dry...and there was zero scent of the soap right after the shower. That was disappointing.  I thought I would smell great at least for a little while. Nope...the nice aroma went away with the rinsing. Next problem...and most significant, the bar lasted exactly one week! $9 for a one week bar of soap is simply not happening. The bar was smaller than I was expecting. In my opinion, $4 a bar would be fair price for a one-week product. Even though I like the smell, they have priced me out from future purchases until the price comes down DRASTICALLY!  Pretty disappointed after their great advertising. Sorry, Dr Squatch!\n",
            "Look, the packaging was awesome. The marketing is absolutely genius. And honestly it's a great soap. The pine tar scent especially. I loved this soap when I tried it. Hell I bought almost all of their scents as well. The pine tar definitely was the best but the goat's milk soap was really good too. Here's the thing, the PRICE! This stuff doesn't last all that long and that's understandable. It is all natural soap. But the shape of the bar although attractive isn't efficient and for 10$ a bar I'd think they'd at least give you a 7oz bar of soap as opposed to a 5oz bar. I tried another brand today (pine tar scent) and it's every bit as good of a bar of soap as this stuff. No it doesn't have the awesome commercials, or the grade A packaging. But it's a bigger bar, the shape is better, the scent might even be a bit stronger, and best of all it's less than half the price. I would recommend Doctor Squatch to anyone who doesn't mind the price tho. It's still a great bar of soap. I'd like to see the shape change to a more rectangle type shape and for the bar to be a good amount bigger for around 7$ a bar tho. That's just like my opinion tho man.\n"

            "This is good soap.  It does not dry out the skin, it smells great, and the ingredients are pretty \"natural\".  I initially notice this soap from the clever commercials that they run on YouTube and TV.  Great content and intriguing marketing.  There are two things that make this soap not worth the price.  They do not last, I take a shower about every day and the bars only last for about three weeks.  Additionally at only lasting three weeks these soap bars are extremely over priced.  I am going to try some of the other natural brands on Amazon before buying these again.\n",
            "Ok ! Great smell and natural. My husband, and now my son, love this bar of soap! I will have to keep purchasing. I only wish this bar of soap was cheaper. I think it should be priced for $4.99, to be honest. It melts just as fast as the others , the Zum bar.  I would compare it to that. That’s a great bar of soap too, and much cheaper. However, this one is suppose to be more natural, and my guys do love it. So I willBut again, regardless.\n",
            "Smells ok but just isn’t special otherwise. Leaves a mess wherever you set it as it’s so dark. Decent sized bar. I suggest buying from someone who makes soap locally wherever you are. This company claims no one makes quality natural soap for men. Pretty sure, at the very least, I have seen patchouli bars at Whole Foods or any farmers market I have ever been to. Also all the cheesy stereotyped man targeted advertising made me cringe.\n",
            "So my hubby had been talking about this product for so long! So I decided to surprise him with it. And I just bought the #1 scent on amazon. Which was the pine tar. Well when it arrived I honestly was not all too attracted to the scent at all. And was a little upset to even give it to my love. But he was excited and loved it. And let me tell you. The scent smells SOOOOO AMAZING once it’s applied and washed off. AND he still won’t stop talking about how his skin feels a week later. He said (and I can second this) “my skin feels like the skin on your butt” 🤣 (soft) so I am super happy with it and so is he!\n",
            "This soap gives up too much and dissolves into nothing too quickly.  It quickly turns mushy and makes me feel.more like I'm trying to leave a thin coat of smelly wax on my skin instead of get clean.  But the ads drew me towards better soap, so I looked into other options after this amd the soap made by Marlowe, amd sold on Amazon were way better.  They keep their shape, exfoliate, and leave skin feeling clean.  Highly recommend Marlowe soaps over this.\n",
            "I do like the smell of pine tar but it doesn’t seem to linger on the skin after you rinse off and dry yourself. I’ve used the soap for a while now and as the bar is getting smaller the pine tar scent isn’t as strong and now is starting to smell like something else. I won’t be buying another pine tar but the abrasive Side of the soap is good to remove dead skin and help cleanse your skin. All in all if you have ever used Irish spring bar soap and dried yourself off and you still smell like Irish spring. This soap doesn’t do that I couldn’t smell it after I dried off.\n",
            "My biggest complaint: The bar itself is too soft; the bar turns mushy really quickly and I end up wasting a lot of soap.  I don't want to, but I could probably squeeze the bar like play-doh in my fist. I have used it for about a week and am already through about a third of it.Other complaints: The scent is just not there, I was hoping for a really piney scent like I just cut down a Christmas tree. Nope, it just smells like soap.Pros: This could be taken as a con to some people, but the soap exfoliates your skin, no doubt about that. It feels like I'm rubbing a piece of 80 grit sandpaper on my body. At first it hurt but I got used to it and actually kind of like that rough exfoliation.I am usually skeptical about products I see on Instagram, they are marketed really well but usually lack in quality. I decided to try this soap because I wanted to use a bar instead of a loofa and this was reviewed well on Amazon. The quality is just not there, a $10 bar of soap should last longer in my opinion.\n",
            "I love trying premium products that use natural ingredients as well as supporting small companies. This seemingly checked all the boxes, so I was very excited to try this product. I mean, who doesn't want to smell herb fresh with skin that glows like a thousands suns, all while knowing it doesn't contain harmful ingredients?Well I can say after using this entire bar, my skin feels worse and I don't feel or smell like a nautical God. In all seriousness for a $9 BAR OF SOAP I was expecting much much more.Pros:- You are using healthy ingredients- Supporting a smaller company(Those are the only reason for the 2 star rating)Cons:- With daily showers it only lasted me about 20 washes.- The smell of the bar is AMAZING. But that doesn't transfer to your skin. After drying off I smelt more like clay (one of the ingredients) than anything else.- Even after a good rinse, there was a filmy feel all over my body from the bar. Did not make me feel clean or moisturized at all.- I have sensitive skin so I need something that gently cleans well and moisturizes, this did not do either. I have more blemishes than before using this product. It didn't even perform the basic function of soap!All in all this is not worth the $9. If it would have worked well as a soap that left me smelling great ,it would still be a premium price, but justified for some. However, this missed the mark in basic soap expectations and I would save your coin for other options.\n",
            "Wow does my husband LOVE this product! We also ordered the 3 pack and wooden soap holder. The soap smells so good and leaves a clean feeling on the skin. Our son is 8 months old and suffers from eczema but we tried the pine tar on him and was great for his sensitive skin. We recommend this product to all of our friends and family. All the different scents we’ve tried really smell amazing and fresh like nature! Definitely worth the price compared to the crap soaps available at local retail locations. Looking forward to a soapscription and whatever else this company produces. Please try this product you will not be disappointed\n",

            "First off, this is a great bar of soap! It smells nice, cleans well, makes my skin feel awesome and I have enjoyed using it. Kudos to this company for making a great product.However, almost $10.00 for a bar of soap (or $7.00 if you buy from their site)? I tried it thinking it would last longer than my usual bar (approximately two weeks). This bar of soap lasted just two weeks of normal use. Thats not a bad thing, I expect a bar of soap to last that long. This is a steep price for one bar of soap to only last that long - a price I can't justify for future purchases. This is the reason for the three stars. I consider the price a major component of a product - therefore a gradable component.As I said, its a really great bar of soap. You may have a longer soap life than my experience which would be great for you. However, for me, I'm happy I tried it but I will look at other options for future soap purchases. If prices change or they bundle multiple bars for this price, I would consider purchasing once again.\n",
            "First off the idea of the soap I like it. The actually product itself is a different story. I bought the Pine Tar and the Nautical Sage. Pine Tar barely lasted a week. Now im on the Nautical SageThere is something in these soaps that are making me breakout and super dry added effect when i shower in warm water my body feels like im being stung where I've applied the soap.This soap isn't designed for me at all.Has anyone else experienced this(It's not as bad as when Old Spice changed its deoderant and started burning ppls skin. I was part of that too)\n",
            "Bought the pine tar scented bar. Was excited to use the bar. Wife wasn't a fan of the smell but I enjoyed it. First use it seemed interesting. I enjoyed it. Placed it out of the shower and on a dry surface. The soap softened to the point of being black goo. So much of the bar came off on my body in the next use it was probably 75% gone by that time. I used it this morning, threw the little sliver of bar that was left away and decided to write this review. Also in my opinion the exfoliating particles in the soap with the black contrast just looked gross.I am not sure what I expected from designer soap as I obviously am not the target market but I gave it a shot. Unfortunately based on price for a single bar I would be spending 30$ a month on bars of soap. Maybe, maybe there is a market for that but I dont live that life style. Unfortunately I cant recommend.\n",
            "Okay, so I bought this product after seeing their clever advertisement on Instagram.. The soap delivers what they promise as far as scent, and moisturizing. The only drawback of this soap is the price per bar. I am a hairy guy, and one bar lasted me just about two weeks using every last drop. Based on the 10$ per bar that is 20$ per month or 240$ per year for soap?! That's a car payment. I get that they are made in small batches, but how much labor does it take to chop a loaf of soap? Unless the price drops, I don't see myself buying any more of this amazing soap.\n",
            "The smell was a cross between medicine and gasoline. I would not recommend this to anyone with a nose, and if you've not got one, please dont purchase out of respect for those who do. The scent was overwhelming and disgusting and quite frankly, I couldn't hit the return to sender button quick enough.\n",
            "To be honest I am not impressed for the price.  I understood that the bars should last a long time.  Here I am on my 3rd shower and it is more than 1/4 the gone.  Very very little sent.  I can't even smell it but my girlfriend smells it a little bit.  Just overall not my fav product by any means.  If I could send it back I would. After my 1st week it broke into 4 smaller pieces and is 85% gone.  Had to press it into a ball.  Never again.\n",
            "I originally just wanted check this soap out, instead I fell in love. It smells so good and actually feels amazing on my skin. I cannot recommend this enough.I have not tried the other scents, because I really love the Pine Tar and my skin smells really good at the end of the day.Weird for a guy to feel like this about a soap, but I really do, I am not one to do all this still to keep your skin young,However in one bar I can wash and exfoliate all at once in the shower, great stuff!\n",
            "When I saw the ad for this company, I was really excited to try this soap. I'm not huge for organic stuff but if I can get it, I will. It also boasted good smells and soft skin, which sounded great. The unfortunate truth is that it did not perform well.Pros:Smells goodSoft skin from itOrganic/NaturalCons:Longevity (I consistently smelled worse by the end of the day than when I used normal bar soap)Price (if it worked, I'd pay, but it doesn't)Roughness (the soap has a very rough surface when scrubbing)Color (the black color of the soap has left dark marks on my white shower)Ultimately, I want this to be a good thing, but it just doesn't stack up. I won't buy again, but I don't regret trying it.\n",
            "My wife walked into the bedroom and asked me what I had cleaned. I said nothing. She looks puzzled and says it smells like a bathroom cleaner in here.... So the smell isn't that good, big deal the bar is great right! Well not so much. First off the oats and stuff used to exfoliate, do just that, kind of rough imo thought. It took a couple of washes to get a decent amount of suds going too... Length of use, I'd say I used it maybe 14-16 showers, I'm not very hairy but I am 6' 3\" and around 250lbs. I feel like it lasted a good length of time and when it got really small it didn't just break into pieces. It stayed together and just got very flexible. I'm not a fan and won't buy again, but there's an honest review for ya.\n",
            "Well I really tried to like it. And the scent is very musky, which It definitively succeeded in. However, I couldn't decide if I liked the smell or not. It was 50/50. Sometimes showering with it gave me the feeling I was washing with an essential oil.Pro's:-The bar of soap seemed to be made of decent quality ingredients.-Very Pine-MuskyCon's:-No matter the method I tried to soften it with, whether holding the bar under water or by lathering it on to a wet wash cloth rather than applying the bar directly, the soap bar itself is very rough and scratchy. And it didn't soften much through the various washings.-Very-Pine-Musky-The Bar of soap is consumed VERY quickly. For the $9 dollars or whatever I bought it with I think it only lasted about five or six showers. I mean I'm a big dude at 6'2 240lbs, but I still feel like the bar should last a bit longer.-If you do like the scent it gives off, which I'm sure many do and I can see the appeal, I just personally didn't, the scent doesn't last more than an hour tops. So not very long.\n"

            "This soap is falsely advertised in many ads across the internet.. The soap doesnt last more than a week (if u shower everyday like you are supposed to). And the scent disappears within literal minutes of using the soap.. And it doesnt feel any different than just washing with water.. It smells good in the shower but once your out. Nothing. And as far as \"moisturizing\" and \"exfoliating\" i would say this soap does none of those things. And for the price you would be better off just visiting your local Bath and Body Works for actual good soap and bath products that you can actually smell hours after your shower. This soap is not it and i strongly caution anybody from giving this company your hard earned money for the most basic and expensive soap you can find. The ads are complete and utter lies. If i could give negative stars i would in a half of a heartbeat. Dr Squatch you are falsely advertising and overcharging. Shame on yall.\n",
            "To begin with all of the soaps in the bundle smell amazing, I'm talking too notch amazing. You would think the commercials were over exaggerating but they weren't as far as the scents.When it comes to sensitive skin, I don't have it, but the citrus bar definitely irritated my skin in the armpit area.As far as moisture it didn't feel any different than a regular bar of synthetic soap.The only downside is that Pine Tar which is my favorite makes the water look filthy when you rinse it off.I would buy this again infrequently though.\n",
            "My first shower using this soap my wife could smell the soap outside in the living room. Second day I asked my wife if she like the smell and she responded that is hard to smell it because I put on cologne.  When I told her I wasn't wearing any her eyes got big and wanted to attack me but our kids were around. My 12 year old boy used it once, came out of the shower with a full beard and a deep voice telling his mother he wants his steak rare with a scotch on the rocks for dinner. Never been more proud. Only downfall is that it doesn't last long. I've gotten 7 or 8 good showers in with one bar of soap.\n",
            "After seeing the Squatch commercials and enjoying them, I decided to try them. The first bar I tried was the citrus one, smelled great to the end, unfortunately the end was about 3 weeks later Next was the pine scent, smelled like PineSol and after a few lathers became prickly and abrasive. And as was the citrus bar, it was gone after 3 weeks. Last bar was the moss bar, it smelled horrible and after a few days I threw it out. This soap may be good for you but most grocery stores carry similar products for a lot less.\n",
            "This is my favorite bar from Dr. Squatch. I have tried two or three of their other bars but this one wins due the exfoliating sand. All the bars smell great and clean well overall.My one complaint is that they breakdown/dissolve very quickly, which I’m assuming is due to their natural and limited ingredient list. Which is also what people are probably looking for when they buy this product. They just get used up so quickly.\n",
            "Going to update this as i go through the soapsPine tar: i smell like i just cut down every christmas tree at the tree farm and i love it as a kid i used to rub pine needles between my hands to smell likes this. So i am very happy. But there are chunks of wood in the soap. Which is weird but effective as far as exfoliating goes. The bar came really thing and with sharp corners the corners went away quickly but its not even been a week and the bar of soap is already half gone. So it goes quick for its price which kinda sucks.\n",
            "I ordered the 5.oz Dr. Squatch “PINE TAR” bar of soap. Before using this soap I have been using Dove bar soap for my face for about last 2/3 weeks give or take. The scent of PINE TAR was 100x better than Dove or any other body wash previously used. So good the entire bathroom smelled clean after my shower. A major reason for wanting to switch over was because of constantly having to apply deodorant throughout the day. I will have to see how well this holds up throughout the day. I saw one person say they stopped using deodorant because of how good this soap is (I will continue to use just hope not as often). I applied directly to my face from hands but used a loofa for body. I could feel the moisture being applied to my face where not as much compared to dove. My face is not dried out like it would when using dove. I have extremely sensitive skin and this feels like it may be the best option for me. If I had to rate I would give it a solid 9/10 so far. Will see how my pits do throughout the day. I will be trying the PIRATES RUM scent next as that seemed to be more of a beach tropical scent.\n",
            "The smell of the Pine Tar soap is great.  The soap is used up very quickly.  If the cost was more in line with the length of time it lasts then I would say it is worth it.  But this soap is too expensive for the amount of time it lasts.  I would have to buy 52 bars to last a year, what is that $520 for a year of soap ????  And where would I store 52 bars of soap.  Just not practical at the cost level.  I feel the cost needs to come down for this to be of value.\n",
            "This was my first time trying a new soap beside the men's dove soap bar. I was mainly intrigued because I heard the scent was extravagant, which it was, and the soap moisturizing worked well. The moisturizing did not have much a difference between the men's dove soaps I used to use, so the main attribute that had me ready to switch over was the scent. I received compliments on my smell and even stuck after I would leave the gym. Just the only factor that limited me from not buying again is the longevity of the product. Once I received it, I began using it right away and I took 2 showers daily. One in the morning and once at night. This soap bar only lasted me a total of 12 days. The consistency isn't that of a hard soap bar like others. It has a soft gel feel to it, I would give it 2 and a half star but I know this isn't a 3-star product for the longevity and the price. I can get 3 soap bars for the same price as one of these that will last me up to 3 weeks.\n",
            "The product itself is excellent. It’s amazing. But I do have a couple of gripes about it. First off the price 😬 I can buy a lot of bars of soaps 🧼 for just one Dr. Squatch soap. Which then leads me to my second point. The bars themselves, as great as they are, don’t last as long as a normal bars of soap in my opinion. They tend to degrade or melt more rapidly than normal bars of soap. I’ve started to store my soap after I’m done using it and not leave it exposed so I can hopefully get more use out of it. Perhaps in the future also have a liquid option if that is possible? 🤔 Having said all that, I like the product and would recommend it to anyone if they can handle the price.\n",

Had to go back to other organic brand.But in fairness have not gone through all the bars yet. Pine Tar was amazing smell and exfoliate but no moisturizer for sensitive skin. Cedar citrus same but not as manly smell and no exfoliation which was fine. Don't keep bar next to shower head easily dissolving.  Best at opposite end from water source. My son (22) loves both and rates 5 stars on both. We cut them in half to try them. I pick the next 1. Going with Cool Fresh Aloe;)\n",
            "Great advertisement because it’s what made me try the soap! One star just for that.The scents smell....... decent? Really doesn’t live up to its hype like I expected but I guess others smell it better than I can because I have gotten compliments on the Cedar Citrus. Haven’t tried the Gold moss yet but I don’t think it’ll live up to the hype either. One star for smellWhile in the shower you can feel the difference in the soap with the exfoliating and moisturizing but soon as I dry off my skin dries pretty bad and i lather up with some lotion. I won’t hold this against the soap just yet because I usually have dry skin a little in the winter.I’m going to try some other scents before I completely give up on it but do not buy this thinking the scents will make girls go crazy trying to smell you. Also going to try cutting it because the bars do not last long at all!\n",
            "I'm always excited to try new soaps especially because no soap is created equally. Let me say that the soap description didn't let me down. I knew I was getting into something musky and masculine. I tried the Pine tar bar and it smells exactly how it sounds. An all natural fragrance of pine and tar. If you wish to smell like cologne after using bar soap, this isn't for you. But if you wanna feel fresh, clean and fierce then Dr. Squatch has what you need. I'm excited to try the other bars they offer. I tried this one first because it has exfoliating properties. It was a little too harsh at first but I got used to it quickly. I go through bar soap like crazy. I lather up something fierce so it didn't surprise me that the bar of soap only lasted about 3 days which is the average use with any bar soap for me. I noticed that the scent becomes much more pleasant once I'm out of the shower. It seems to mix well with my manly scent. I recommend it to all you tough guys who refuse to use body wash or the wife's dove soap junk.\n",
            "I saw this product advertised on Facebook and thought I give it a try.Overall I’m really happy with it. The scent is amazing but it doesn’t last long. The scent is gone after 2-3 hours. This all depends what you do. I work from home sitting in my office.The scent isn’t a deal breaker.I have sensitive skin and breakout easily. One thing I do notice is that this soap doesn’t over dry my skin compared to other soaps. It keeps my skin moisturized.I’m going to try other products/scents. Worth the purchase.\n",
            "All I can say is this soap does everything it said it could. I didn't realize how the other soaps made my skin feel till I used this soap. This soap is kind of rough but can still be applied directly to the skin with no problems. As far as how long this soap last... well I been using it for 2 weeks now and still have over a half left and that's 2 showers a day but I keep my soap dry when I'm not using it and I recommend getting the wooden soap dish they advertise. Also I saw reviews where people complain about the price being high but I'm willing to pay it to feel clean and fresh\n",
            "This is definitely one of the better bar soaps that I've used. The scent is wonderful, it lathers very well, and ir makes my skin ver soft and smooth. My only problem with this soap is that it doesn't last very long. I shower twice a day, and I used a bar of soap in a week. That's kinda lame. Like I said though, it's probably because I shower often. I won't be buying it again, just because it would get so expensive having to buy soap so often. If it lasted longer it would get a 5 for sure.\n",
            "First off, the smell and exfoliating feature is great.  Don't let that go unoticed.  However, it went so fast and I kept it out of the water the entire time.  It melted faster than Monica went down on bill.  And for the cost, the bar is super small.  There are plenty of other brands out there around the same price where you get so much more soap!  It sucked because it didn't last worth a crap.\n",
            "I like how the soap really lathers my body compared to other brand soap products I have used. The only reason why I've given it a 4 out of 5 is due to the smell. I didn't know what pine tar smelled like, saw the review infomercials about it and had high hopes. The smell is very strong, like taking one of those pine trees that people place in their car and multiple the pine smell by 2x. I might have to try another bar soap \"flavor\" to find which is a better scent for my sense of smell. If your product was sold at a store where I could quickly compare smells, that would make my decision to buy much easier because I would not have to just trust based on verbal descriptions on your website. Not sure if this is helpful in creating newer smells for future bars, smells that I like, as a man, are Black Ice (these are one of those car pine trees), Bourbon (this smell comes from one of those mens lotions/body wash from Bath & Body works), or specific colognes (Yves Saint Laurent or my favorite Creed Aventus). I've only been using this bar soap for 3 days now & it's doing pretty good on the longevity test. Normally, brand soap products (when I've used them raw, instead of lathering them on a wash cloth), can last about 5-7 days when both my wife & I are using it. So far, it looks like this bar may go past that time frame, just a bit. It may be due to the fact that only I'm using it instead of both of us...but still. I was a bit concerned at first because the bar is 5oz. However, I'm assuming it last longer because it the soap has less contact with water and usage when it's only be used once a day by me (I normally take one shower a day).\n",
            "I have very sensitive skin when it comes to my face. I would not recommend scrubbing this soap on the face of you have sensitive skin it’s very rough on the skin. Secondly, it smells like pinesol. Don’t get me wrong it smells good but on the skin? It just doesn’t make sense. Lastly, the soap really does just last 1 week and if you skip a shower or 2 you can maybe make it last 1 and a half weeks. Overall, I would not recommend this soap, I sure many of you guys are attracted to it from so many ads but please just save your money and just buy your normal soaps that you can find at target or Walmart.\n",
            "I the Gold Musk and Cedar Citrus but didnt get to the pine.  First application I broke out in a rash literally all over my stomach and thighs.  Gave it a few days and tried the other Citrus same result if not worse!  I cant use this product. Whatever \"organic oils\" they use definately cause skin irritation and rashes.  Im not going to even try the pine!  Back to simple soap seems to work just fine.\n"

            "Not worth the hype or the tenner. Husband had this on xmas list after being suckered by the ad campaign. As soon as it arrived I had to agree with other reviewers who arent drinking the Squatch kool-aid-there is nothing special about this soap. In fact, it stinks like the cleaner I mop the kitchen floor with. Only lasted 10 days of showering and was so abrasive my husband thought his nipples were ripped open (they werent). I will gladly buy him all the Harry’s soap he wants from now on. Half the price and smells and feels a million times better. Don’t be suckered by Squatch and that long hair blowing in the breeze spokesguy.\n",
            "I'm going to start off with what I LIKE. I like how every single ingredient is completely natural, and how there's no form of preservatives or dyes. I think it's clever to use activated charcoal for its color, and it was very appealing to see actual oatmeal chips in the bar. The smell wasn't overly strong like I was hoping, though it was still present. Now what I DISLIKE about the soap is how long it lasts. I bought two bars hoping they would last me the entire month, but I guess with all the natural ingredients and no preservatives that was a bit of a challenge to overcome. Next is the sand, I know the soap I bought were exfoliating bars and they decided to use sand as a natural abrasive force, but damn. I like the idea of using a natural ingredient that's commonly found for skin care purposes, however I don't like the sensation of what feels like a rough brick being scraped against my body (Especially when you're not ready for it). This could potentially be a problem for people who have sensitive skin or sunburns. One more thing (this is just me) that is a little pestering is the fact that I have to rinse out the soap dish in the side of my shower often because of the charcoal. I guess since it doesn't last long, the bar tends to naturally diminish and leave black streaks down the side of my shower (which isn't really pleasant to see in my opinion). I get that because of the all natural factor, but I feel like there could be some natural ingredients out there that could bind the soap together better. I think this brand of soap is far better than the generic brands like Dove and Suave, though you do run into some drawbacks. But then again you have to weigh it out in your hands whether you want a bar of soap that is all natural, moderately fragrant, and not artificially long-lasting OR if you want a bar of soap that is artificial, strongly fragrant because of added chemicals, and is longer lasting due to preservatives. Overall, I give this soap a 7/10. It's not the best bar of soap I've ever used in my life, but it's a step up from what I'm using.\n",
            "I purchased a bar of the Dr. Squatch Pine Tar. I have never felt as clean or has my skin felt so refreshed. Usually when I use bar soap I feel as if I have a shell over my skin or that it has stripped all the oils away, but not with Dr Squatch. After the first time using it my skin feels clean and hydrated, no shell feeling as previously mentioned. I was skeptical about the sand as I've used soaps with similar claims but the sand actually sticks in the soap and isn't too abrasive. The smell is also amazing! It isn't over powering like some soaps and it doesn't lack smell either. It smells natural and lingers gently. When I got out of the shower my wife smelled my arm and loved it. Being made in America and such a quality product I will be recommending Dr. Squatch to everyone. 10 out of 10 all around, the only way you could possibly improve this product is if tiny creatures actually came out of the soap and washed your body for you.. This soap lacks nothing.\n",
            "Areas of dry skin stopped being a problem after 2-3 weeks of use. I didn't even realize this could make that better when I started. I love the natural ingredients of this soap. The only reason I didn't give it a full 5 stars is because it is priced too high for me to use regularly. $5/bar and I'll continually use this soap. $10/bar (actual price) and I'll have to order occasionally. Great product, too high a price for soap.\n",
            "So the scents are great...however the bars do not lay long as soon as hey get wet they deteriorate...the scents don’t last...over good scents but don’t last, everything else about it is no good. The bar lasted about a week ...shower ..it sticks to any surface you set it on like glue then you have to pry it off mangling the bar and it just getting weaker and almost melting away as you use it. I’ll personally be going back to Harry’s brand\n",
            "UPDATE: The bar only lasted 4.5 showers. I use my soap rigorously, but expecting to spend more than a bar a week is bit ridiculous. I can't recommend this product at this price unless you really have the money to spend or have medical conditions requiring organic soap.ORIGINAL REVIEW: I've seen the ads and whatnot and they do a good job with them. I figured I'd give it a shot. It's a little on the small side for the price, but that's not my problem with it. When using it in the shower, it smells great and does feel good, just like others say. However, that's where it stops. The ads make it seem like it leaves you smelling great... And based on the smell in the shower, I figured it would, but that's my issue, it doesn't.I really went at it with the bar, scrubbing arms, chest and back quite throughly. I then went to my wife (who can smell what the neighbors 3 houses down are having for dinner) within 5 minutes of getting out of the shower and... nothing. She said she couldn't even tell that I used it. I smelled my arm and she was right, I couldn't even tell I had showered, which is super disappointing.I'll keep using the bar, but after it's done, I'll be going back to my Cremo body wash that leaves me clean AND smelling amazing.All in all, it lives up to the hype until the endgame, where it unfortunately turns to ash like Spiderman.\n",
            "I the Pine tar bar because I was breaking out in pimples on my neck, chest, and body so I figured maybe I was sensitive to over the counter chemical based soaps and body washes. I also have very oily skin. This actually started clearing me up in a matter of days. The sand exfoliates the skin and leaves me feeling very clean when I get out of the shower. I found it worked best if I used it twice a day (morning and before bed) for my acne situation. Only thing is it only lasted a week.. I guess if you use it once a day it could be stretched to 2? Although I see this is a common complaint. If you do their subscription plan you can get 3 bars a month for $20 which is a great savings off of buying a single bar.\n",
            "I really appreciated how this soap marketed itself. It’s supposed to be a hand crafted, outdoorsy, manly, Sasquatchy soap with a hint of sophistication. I can definitely get on board with that. The soap is pleasant to look at, it smells great, and it gets you clean. My real hang up is that it’s too expensive for what it is. It’s NOT 8$/bar soap. It fell apart too quickly in both the shower AND in the soap dish. During my shower, when my mind really wanders, I kept coming back to the thought: Man, I paid 8$ for this bar of soap and there is nothing that amazing about it. This soap has turned me on to the idea of trying other soaps, since there is more to life than 10 years of washing with Dove Men+Care. I think this would make a great gift, because then the price gets taken out of the equation for the user, and that was my main hang up.\n",
            "Bought the 5-pack. All five smell pretty similar, very little defining difference. The cool aloe was the only one out of the five that smelled noticeably different.The lather is pretty good, I liked the exfoliating feature of the soaps. However the soaps left me feeling dry after use, as if all natural oils had been stripped from my skin.My biggest complaint is how long the scent lasted after bathing. It seemed, to me at least, that the moment I stepped out of the shower the smell stopped. I even asked my wife if I smelled good, her only response was that I smelled \"clean\".Overall I liked that the soap was natural and good for the environment, but will not be purchasing again.\n",
            "So I tried this product after seeing many of the ads on social media. I was anxious to try and when I received it and used the first time I thought it smelled awesome. But I quickly noticed after about 30 to 40 minutes after the shower I couldn't smell the aroma any longer. I even asked my wife can you smell the new soap I purchased and she said no. So for $10 I just feel that the smell the aroma should have been there longer like when I use Irish spring or dove which seems to last all day.\n"

            "I dont know what happened here and i understand its hand crafted. But.... i originally got a pine tar and loved it.. i bought this pack around prime days and all three soaps just smelled like piney shae butter, shae butter, and nasty shae butter... the pine tar didnt smell anything like the first one i bought.. the other two just smelled like slightly different shae butters.. im not paying top dollar for that much inconsistency, regardless of hand made or not... found another brand at a fraction of the price that works fine..\n",
            "I've been seeing ads for this soap for so long now and finally decided to give it a try. I've gotta say, it's definitely the best bar soap I've ever used. And I don't really see myself going back to gel bodywashes after this.The only thing I would say is the Pine Tar might not be the best if you are on the more sensitive skin side. As there are small chips of wood (i think?) in the bar of soap. I believe you are meant to lather the soap in your hands and then apply it to your body, which would make it significantly less painful, but im too lazy for that tbh. I'll endure and pick another scent after 😅\n",
            "Nice soap, but the price is insane. When you can get a beautiful hand made bar or soap with better ingredients at a farmers market or natural shop, it's hard to justify spending the money on this.That said, my 10 yr old son was insisting he use some cheap green body wash, loaded with chemicals like his dad and stepdad use. The Dr. Squatch commercial completely sold him. So I'll gladly pay the outrageous price for my little guy to use something safe and natural!\n",
            "Every soap I've used left me with hand rashes and dry skin, this is the first that hasn't.Pro:An incredible scent that lasts longDoes what soap should doActually moisturizesDoesn't leave a rash for those with sensitive skinCons:ExpensiveNeeds a soap dishCan leave a nasty black line if it overflows from soap dishOverall, I absolutely love this soap, but my god is it expensive. I highly recommend you try this soap out at the very least, and make sure you cut the soap into 4 pieces so it lasts longer. Use one piece at a time, don't let the soap dish become a bath, and the whole bar should last you more than a month, if not 2 depending on your shower routine.$10 every month so my hands don't rash after a shower is absolutely worth it, at least for me.\n",
            "It smells good, feels good like let's just say, ya know how when you use other bar of soaps, ya just want to get it over with and enjoy mostly the warmth from the shower head? Well, Dr. Squatch makes you enjoy the shower even more because with how it smells and feels for your skin.BY THE WAY, when I passed by the bathroom where I showered, smelled good in fresh in there 🛀\n",
            "The non-stop advertisements on this product made me feel like it was groundbreaking and that I should try it. So I paid the obscene amount of money for a single bar of soap; boy did I regret it. Here are my grievances 1. IT IS RIDICULOUSLY expensive, I mean I expect something amazing if I am dishing out 8 USD for a bar soap. 2. The scent (which their add makes it feel like you will be smelling heaven) was not any better the the Dial or Palmolive I have at home. 3.  I fail to understand the significance of the detergent designation. I understand that detergents are horrible on your skin, but the entire world uses soap, so its classification as detergent is not that significant (as the add would make you believe). So all in all, if you have money laying around, and you like average smelling soap, this is an option.\n",
            "What got me into this was the funny advertisement video. Because they did a great job on the video, I figured I would see if their product is also quality. You know what the say, \"you get what you pay for\". So I made an investment in a quality company. So far I really like the soap. At first the soap is a bit rough. But, I'm not a manly man anymore either, so you'll have to ask mountain men and Texas Hotshots about that.Tip: along with any scents, the scent lasts longer with air drying.\n",
            "Been using this for a few weeks now. I do like the pine smell, and it cleans well. If you have sensitive skin, then this is not for you because it has a scratchy pumice feel to it, but I suspect most guys won't be bothered by that, and I suppose it's for exfoliating dead skin cells. Can't say I've noticed it moisturizing any more than other soaps, but I'll just say it doesn't leave a dry feeling at least.  Anyway, if you don't want to smell like other flowery soaps, or if you're just looking to mask your scent while hunting wild game through a pine forest, this soap will do the trick.\n",
            "I really enjoyed the look and feel of the soap, I felt clean and refreshed if you will. However, the pine tar smells like pinsol floor cleaner. I am willing to try other scents as over I enjoyed the product, but another thing to mention is the stuff only lasts about 10 days with 1 or less showers a day. All the reviews here that say it doesn’t last are spot on.I am going to try a few other scents but I don’t except to use this product regularly for the price.\n",

            "I have been seeing squatch for a while now. I’ve been trying lots of soaps to find one I liked and because it’s everywhere I finally gave in to try it. It’s literally the same as any other natural bar soap but also not that great. It didn’t last long. Definitely not worth the $10 a bar. Even for brand name. A soap that I just found and am a big fan of is duke canons thick body wash. I got the tobacco scent. First body wash I’ve had that I still smell post  shower.\n",
            "The marketing campaign for this soap caught my attention and after reading some decent reviews I thought it would be a good idea to try it out. When it arrived, it smelled really good and I was excited to try it out. During my first use, I noticed the scent had almost gone away as soon as it got wet. After washing myself with it, I could barely smell anything and asked my fiance if I smelt any different. She said she didn't notice a difference. Also, it feels like any other soap you could buy at the store (which is way cheaper by the way). The texture of the soap is also very uncomfortable. For how expensive this is, you'd think it should last you a couple of months AT LEAST but I only got mine a month ago and it's now gone.  Don't waste your money on this soap when you can get a 12 pack of irish spring at the store for half the price of this.\n",
            "I recieved the wrong items.  Ordered the bay rum 5 pack and received the 5 multipack.  Soaps smell good looks like they will last a few weeks.  Makes the whole bathroom smell good too.\n",
            "I saw the ads and thought I would give it a shot. They have clever marketing, however the product was very underwhelming. It smells good when you just smell the soap. The smell of it however once you finish washing, doesn't last long, so don't expect yourself to smell like it.  It has a faint smell on skin after use. I do not like soap bars personally, but I didn't mind this one. It didn't feel sticky like other ones, and it did lather on nice. It has some scrub stuff in it that acts as an exfoliant, but this could be seen as a little too harsh on the skin. Personally, not for me, the smell didn't stay long, but it did lather nicely.  Won't be buying this product again.\n",
            "It smells like a household cleaner and the oats inside the bar left scratch lines on my skin to the point I threw it away. I understand it’s supposed help but it’s like a very course sandpaper type feel. So the bad smell and it feeling like the bar is filled with rocks I wouldn’t recommend.  However I would recommend the fresh aloe scent, that stuff is amazing!\n",
            "After being bombarded by ads for over a year I figured I'd try it out. The smell and feel are actually great, it's not bad soap, thus the three stars. But for $10/bar we should all feel taken. Lasted 3 weeks, using sparingly and keeping dry. Not big enough or long lasting enough to justify the price, under $5 and I'd consider being a repeat customer, at the current price this is a one off for me.\n",
            "Not sure what kind of earth shattering experience I was expecting for a $9.99 bar of soap ($9.99 IS a bit much for a bar of soap but I got caught up in the great marketing campaign they have). I was told it smells like I took a bath in a bottle of pine sol (but it seems fine to me). It leaves a black streak in the bath tub so that is probably an undesired result for most people. Overall it seems ok. Nothing great but probably money that would be better spent elsewhere. A bar only lasted 15 showers for me.\n",
            "Soap smells great- smell doesn't last long and neither does the bar.Bar- its really exfoliative, after reading reviews on how soft the soap is i went through the trouble of cutting the bar into 4 smaller cubes, then removing the soap from the shower to prevent it from getting goopy (cold process soaps are always pretty soft) and it only lasted me about 10-12 showers. A dollar per shower is terrible.Scent- pine tar scent is great--while you're in the shower. 5 minutes after a shower you're completely unable to smell any trace of this soap. Which is why (im assuming) in all the ads they have people smelling a bar of soap instead of smelling someone that had used the soap.Would not recommend unless you like spending alot of money on soap that provides alot of exfoliation and very little post-shower scent.\n",
            "I originally purchased this bar soap after considering all of the positive reviews and unfortunately I’m not liking it very much, although I do love the scent and the fact that it rinses clean off. What I don’t like is that the little bits of exfoliant were painfully abrasive on my skin and I’m not someone who has sensitive skin. I have to wonder if maybe bar I received came from an off batch? I’d love to give it another shot based on the good but am not about to drop another $10 just to find out.\n"

            "Well, it does smell great. I like the exfoliating part the best. The soap’s durability/length of use seems short-lived, it seems to be melting a lot quicker than I was expecting compared to other soaps.Also, I’m not sure if I wasn’t supposed to use this on my face, but since I’ve started I’ve been breaking out with bad acne all over my face. No problems or sensitivity anywhere else on me; I checked the ingredients and I’m not allergic to anything. I’ve stopped using it on my face and my skin problems are starting to clear up. Overall smells nice, not sure if it’s worth the steep price.Great commercials though.Jake\n",
            "My bf loves these bars. He says they smell great and lather very well. I thought they were really small for the price and I found the smell to be pretty minimal. Didn’t even last a week. The bar was way too soft, there’s absolutely nothing to them. Pine tar left black debris all over our shower. I’ll be looking for similar products with better value\n",
            "It is a really nice soap. However, at almost $10 a bar (I know it's  a bit cheaper if you buy more than one) I can't justify the cost, when one bar barely makes it through 7 showers.I made sure to rinse and put on a soap-saver, outside of the shower, but this bar of soap literally melts in your hands while you are lathering with it. There is no way I can justify spending $30 plus a month to bathe myself.I'm sure this is true of any natural, handmade soap. I also take pretty hit showers, which may add to the accelerated usage. Who knows. I'm sure I could find a local artisan who sells at 3 bucks a bar.\n",
            "Dear Dr. Squatch,When I ordered your product on one beautiful day,The extent of my happiness could not be contained.When Pine Tar soap was brought to my name,I knew my life would never be the same.As the water from my shower head turned to rain,My pure gratitude I could not contain,As each raindrop trickled down the drain,The last thing on my mind was complaint.The soap, it brought me back to Maine,The days of chopping wood and hunting game,And the strong, vivid trees in the forest glade,The scent of a man it truly made.As I end my Amazon review,Warm welcome will be brought to the Amazon I knew,The Amazon River Dr. Squatch brought me to,5 Stars- I proudly give to you.-Pierce L.\n",
            "The product is as described, smells great and helps to moisturize.I've recently finished a few bars of 'tar soap' sold on amazon and they are like plastic or leave a wax residue. Having severe dry scalp, I was searching for a medical-type aid to relieve a lot of that pain and irritation - thus coal tar was top of the list... unfortunately I've subjected my scalp to products that were nothing more than imitation or worse.Very happy I found this product - It works and feels great! I love the scent too - definitely buying more!\n",
            "Look, it smells good, lathered fine, oats were decent exfoliant, but at the end of the day, the marketing hype is just playing you.It's all about how \"harsh chemicals from (Dove type) soap is hurting your skin.\" And \"we have all natural oils\", etc. It's like 75% unwarranted, healing crystal and essential oil, hype.Lye is a caustic chemical and historically, soaps were made from animal fats (which are also technically chemicals). Just because someone uses the scientific name for the scent chemical from lavender, doesn't mean it's more toxic than lavender essential oil. PLUS, \"natural\" ingredients aren't always great. Poison Ivy essential oil would still be a very very bad natural ingredient to put in soap.Bottom line:1) The marketing makes me angry (hyping natural and good-for-you vs. BIG SOAP and their CHEMICALS)2) It's $10/bar that lasted me 1 month of showering. $120/year is A LOT when you can buy a 12 pack of Irish Spring for $6.3) Maybe I don't have sensitive skin, but it didn't make a big difference to me vs. something like Irish Spring. Maybe more lather-y and has non-sand grit (oats), but my skin is still dry as ever.4) It's decent soap, but in my opinion, it's just as soapy and safe as other soaps.Hope this helps,-Keith\n",
            "Before I got this soap I never had tiny creatures crawling all over my body now apparently I have mites the only thing in my life that has changed is I started using doctor squatch soap because I liked the smell now as you can see on my head I also have sores on my fingers on the side of my head in my crotch armpits toes and I feel like my skin is crawling 24/7 if anybody knows a good lawyer or something please let me know\n",
            "I had to really search hard to find the actual ingredients list. It’s not on the label which is quite deceiving. Some people are calling it organic which it never claims to be but people need to stop because it’s definitely not. Finally on the website there is a page of the FULL list of ingredients and then it lists which products contain that ingredient. That’s where I found “fragrance” listed. Unfortunately I purchased after I found that page but figured I’d at least get to smell it to see if the hype was real. It does not smell good at all. Definitely does not smell like oils were used and my husband and I are very sensitive to artificial fragrance. One whiff and we sent it back. So if you’re looking for REAL natural soap this is not it.\n",
            "This product may be a fake but I have Botton two bars of soap, one about a month ago and another five more recently about a week ago. The first one was an amazing experience with a good scent and good soap qualities, but the newer ones we have purchased are merely a mockery and a disgrace to the first one they were blonde St. Louis one felt like Plato and one fell almost like a rock I fear that the company could be cutting corners and just trying to mass produce the product and optimize profits by removing quality out of the picture. I’m hoping that since this is off Amazon but it is a bootleg rip off somehow sold through this site.\n",
            "This soap is okay. I find the oatmeal addition to be unnecessary, and they feel as hard as wood chips, which some have said they are. Salt is all that it needed.The scent... It's not terrible but it's not pine. It smells more like Cometh cleaner than anything. Just not good.Would not buy again. The square shape is silly. Just make a rectangle.\n",

            "Yes it's good soap. Yes it has good ingredients. But I can get THREE TIMES as much good pine tar soap with good ingredients that doesn't just last a week like Squatch does. Ollie Rocket! Yes its on amazon. I wanted to love Squatch, and for the most part I did. But it disappeared quicker than a deadbeat dad. So I had to find a longer lasting soap. A for effort (S rank for marketing, those commercials are spot on) but B in execution.\n",
            "My husband has super sensitive skin, so I was nervous to try a new soap. After a week of using it, still no reactions or breakouts! The smell is amazing and I even started using it too. The only bad thing about the bar, is when you use it the first time. It is an exfoliator, so it has hard peices in it to scrub. It was super sharp at first and left scratches on my husband (nothing that broke the skin). Found out they suggest to lather it in your hands to avoid this. Now that we have used it a bit, it isn't sharp anymore and use it straight on the body again with no issues.\n",
            "Honestly, the worst soap I have ever used. Nothing like the ads on social media and such a dissapointment in the performance. The soap does not clean your body even after scrubbing. I was left with scratch marks all over my body after using the soap because its VERY course. The leave little chunks of hard particles and after 2 days of use I pulled out a hard chunk of what looked like wood and it was about the size of a pea. The soap also does not do well on my tub floor. The tile is stained black from where I've been placing it and I have nearly fallen on multiple occasions because it makes my tub floor EXTRMELY slippery. I even have grip pads on the floor and it still is very slippery. I am very dissapointed and will not use this again.\n",
            "I decided to give Dr. Squatch a shot because their commercials made me laugh, and hey, that's at LEAST worth a tenner or so with how dreadful most commercials are now.But yeah, I don't know if it's because this particular part of the country is cold with very low humidity, but two of the soaps I've tried so far (Citrus and Golden Moss) have dried out my skin during the day, so I have to steal my coworker's lotion so my arms don't peel, and accept that my back is going to be slightly itchy during the day.  Gonna try the pine tar once the other two run out, but so far I'm not really digging Dr. Squatch.  Also, I only really get maybe 2 weeks ish out of a bar, so as far as \"value\" goes, I'm not really feeling the value, all things considered.\n",
            "Upon opening the package soap, I could smell the aroma of pine. After applying the soap, I could tell my manhood had improved by 62.7%. I wasn’t the same man after that shower. I could sense my surroundings, my wife clawed through my button down red checkered shirt just to get a better scent of the man smell coming off my now, beefy chest. All of a sudden, my beard grew 25% larger & had the urge to hunt. I trekked out to the wilderness to find big game to hunt, instead I discovered Big Foot in the north west region of Washington state. They took me in as one of their own. Taught me what it meant to be alive. I will never forget my time with them as I travel back to my family in Utah. What I am trying to say, it’s a good soap and really anyone should use it.\n",
            "The Dr. Squatch Pine Tar soap is not particularly bad, but there are more things I don't like about it than things I do. First, the smell is okay but it seems to be a little more tar than pine and ends up being much too strong to be less than pleasant. If I liked the scent more, I wouldn't mind that it makes the whole room smell. The exfoliating bits of what seem like wood are pretty harsh for me and I'm not usually sensitive skinned, so I can imagine someone else using this might be uncomfortable. Finally, my biggest problem is despite my best efforts to preserve it between uses, the soap wears out much too fast for the price.\n",
            "I first bought this for my husband around Christmas for a stocking stuffer. I was worried he would think it was too stong, but he absolutely LOVES it. When it arrived, I could smell it through the Amazon packaging but once he washed with it, it didn't smell nearly as strong. He loved it so much, he immediately Subscribed to get it every month. He's very happy with it and would highly recommend! The only downside is the cost.\n",
            "Let me start of by saying,  this soap is 100% awesome. The smell, the work it puts in to clean. All worth every penny...where this product lacks is in the longevity department.$10 for soap isn't cheap, but if it works, great. This soap works, but not for more than a  month.Its honestly a shame, if it was a half the price cheaper ($5) I'd be switching and never getting another brand again.As it stands, $10 per month  on soap is ridiculous.\n",
            "Smells fantastic, but not with $10 per bar. Doesn’t last very long, the pine tar bar makes a mess, and I see no reason to believe that it is superior to Dove or any other brand name. The bar isn’t as sudsy as I would have hoped, it didn’t seem uniquely beneficial for my skincare (although using the soap certainly was not detrimental to my skin)—and overall—it just seems like a regular, unremarkable bar of soap with slick advertising. Apparently this product is “all-natural”, which, if true, is great! However many products these days make dubious claims of being “handcrafted” and/or “environmentally friendly”. Lastly, I question their assertion that your skin is more fragrant after showering with this soap. I shower twice a day and no one ever told me that I smell like what the soap smells like... just very disappointed. Overall not bad but not good. Not a lot of bang for your buck.\n",
            "I really like the scent of this. The exfoliating “grit” in the bar feels good on the skin when using. The only down side is the bar is on the delicate side and really melts away fast with each use. Faster than I’m used to with traditional bar soaps. As a result when the bar is used down to maybe 25% of its original size it’s difficult  to apply because it’s so soft and delicate. If my bar hadn’t broke in two just from running it across my leg and further melted from shower water runoff I probably could have got another couple days use out of it.\n"

            "Good soap overall. It does not leave my skin feeling dry or flaky (I have dry skin to begin with). Also the smell is very pleasant and even acts as a second candle in my bathroom. Those are all the good things. If you look at my picture attached here, the “exfoliating” aspect of it, can be a bit too sharp. Today I took a very normal shower, lather up not too roughly and when I rinsed off, I was shocked of how many scratches the sopa left on my skin. Kind of a turn off if every time I shower, I need to be careful not to cut myself with my soap. I think you can agree, that should not be part of your daily shower routine.\n",
            "I was excited to try this soap, but don't think I will buy again. I started using the Pine Tar soap on Christmas and by New Year's it was over 95% dissolved. At over $9.00 a bar that isn't a good deal.  The soap does smell nice and I enjoyed using it, but can't afford over $1 per shower for soap.  I didn't like the sharp pieces I encountered at the first use, but these went away by the third use.\n",
            "While I love this product, I'm not sure I'm in the market for spending 9 bucks a bar.  If this product were more like 5 bucks a bar, I'd do their subscription thing.  But at 9 bucks, mmm, I don't think so.  I'm a guy yes, but I'm not a stupid guy ;)  Frugal is more like it.  So I'll buy a bar now and then.  Marketing department, take that to heart.  You want subscribers (make it up in quantity sales, not unit price).\n",
            "I love this soap as it doesn’t dry out my skin like body washes or regular bars of soap do. It leaves a wonderful scent on your body that isn’t overwhelming. I just wish they could formulate a way for each bar to last longer. I get maybe 8-9 very nice showers out of each bar but it could just be me as I’m very particular about my showers.\n",
            "I Love the scent of this soap. From the moment I opened the package I knew I'd be buying more to test. I've only been using it for a few days but I notice that my face hasn't had a break out since beginning. I have sensitive skin so that's the norm. Hearing about the all-natural ingredients made me realize the soap that I've been using might not be good for me. Great scent(nautical sage is next). All-natural ingredients. Genius marketing. Couldn't pass up on it! Lol..... My only issue is the price. $10 per bar will definitely make it hard to consistently buy. May have to check out the package deals.... I may edit this later if I don't get enough washes with it.\n",
            "Its a solid piece of bar soap! it last longer than your ordinary soap. It has slightly rough texture that makes it an instant scrub for your body! You just need to get used to it! I know the price is pretty high but i assure you its worth it! By the way the smell of it is not normal due to its nature of being tar but then again as soon as you use it you will surprise you. It smells great!\n",
            "I really enjoyed the smell, feel of the soap and how my skin felt, the biggest issue I had was how long a bar lasted. I could only use the bar 3-5 times before I had to throw it away. Seems that if you leave the bar in ur soap caddy in your shower, the moisture causes the materials to slowly break apart and flow down the shower drain. I have a black trail of pine tar and charcoal going straight down my drain. I really hope they fix this because spending 40-50 dollars a month on soap that I like is stopping me from purchasing another bar until they can figure this issue out. Right now, it's a waste of money and I see why they can afford all of those commercials since you only get a few uses before the soap is just trash. Disappointing 😞.\n",
            "I had my expectations a little to high for this product. This product isn’t bad at all if anything I think it’s a great soap but it’s durability is terrible. You’ll have good experience with this for like the first 5 days after that it really doesn’t do the same thing as it did in the first couple of showers. I understand it’s a hand soap and with scrubbing and with water It’ll become less of its shape and getting soft but I’ve seen other hand soap that last longer. Another thing the smell needs some upgrade. It isn’t terrible but it can be better and it also doesn’t last long at all. For its price I think you better off buy something else if you looking for something that last longer and that it comes in pack for the same price as this product. Hope to see this product being better so I can actually buy this again.\n",
            "For decades, I have been using body wash from various suppliers and I may smell good afterwards, my skin just never felt good afterwards. I would always feel dried up and need to use lotion. Legit, after the first use of this, my skin felt hydrated after I had dried off. That's the effect that I want. Now I won't deduct a star for the pricing, but I feel that I am going to spend more on the year in this soap than I would with other products.\n",
            "I bought this soap based on the ads and I'm a bit disappointed.  I really wanted to like this soap but the scent was underwhelming.  It really smells like generic bar soap and I really thought it would be something a bit... more.  I don't know, maybe one of the other scents is better?  The lather and moisturizing are spot on though.Update: Great customer care!  They reached out to me and were able to honor the satisfaction guarantee.  I ended up getting a bar of pine tar and it is everything I wanted out of the scent and the other aspects of the soap are great.  Thank you Dr. Squatch!\n",

            "This is my first time ever leaving a review on Amazon. Mind you, I've bought hundreds of items from them in the past few years. This soap inspired me. Odd to say, I know. I was reluctant to buy from their site. Sure, their prices are a buck or 2 cheaper, but, last I checked, you had to spend $35 to get free shipping. I wanted to try before I committed. I was NOT disappointed. The mild sand infused in the soap makes you feel amazingly clean. The scent is strong and invigorating while you shower, but not overwhelming once you dry off. I can't wait to try their other scents!\n",
            "Great stuff. Liked it so much I bought some for my brother and a variety pack for myself. The scent and the exfoliants are amazing. Makes my skin feel super soft. All other soaps are disappointing now lolMy only complaint is that the Pine Tar doesn't last very long. (Or at least the one I got). The other kinds seem to last longer. Still worth it though.\n",
            "The reason I tried these soaps like most of us was because of the ads. Like all ads they do stretch the truth a little bit. The scent they claim will drive women crazy is gone as soon as you step out of the shower. The scent last as long as the bar of soap.But the way I found to make one bar of soap last a month. I cut or break the bar in half. I wet my body first then I use the bar on my body, build up a nice lather rinse off & repeat. Try to kept the soap out of the water as much as you can.I've been using this product about 2 months and I can feel and see my skin getting softer, smoother and moisturize.If you dont have a problem with the price then I definitely recommend buying them. Also you can get them for around $7.⁵⁰ a bar on the Dr. Squatch website if you buy 6 or more bars\n",
            "I love the smell, it's a little hard to describe, but I like it on my skin. doesn't last very long, but I suppose it shouldn't anyway, and the exfoliating material in the soap makes for a good scrubbing after a long day. I tend to go through it relatively fast, showering and scrubbing my entire body every other day, but it's worth it.\n",
            "Just had my first shower with the pine tar soap, and I have to say my skin feels clean and I smell great. I think a lot of the negative reviews regarding this product are users who are mishandling the soap. I recommend the following; cutting the soap into squares and using one at a time, isolating the soap away from water, keeping the soap in plastic bags to keep the scent \"sealed\" and during the shower rinsing yourself off then cut off the water lathering up followed by a final rinse. It saves water and you get maximum value out of your soap! I hope this helps,  and I really hope the company is taking notes and informs it's customers of the best way to handle their product.\n",
            "I really wanted to love this soap. I like the brand and the idea of the cool smells.Sadly I was highly disappointed. I should have bought a single bar direct from their website for $7 instead of having to buy 3 bars at a much higher price per bar on amazonThe 1st bar I tried was Pine TTara. It's black and looked manly. Cool. However the soap foam and water run off is black or gray too. Which is pretty dirty feeling when showering to get get clean.My larger complaint is how soft it is. Softest soap I've ever used. It shrunk drastically first wash. I also dropped it, luckily not in prison. It got so dented and stuck to the floor. Its just way too soft.All in all good job on the fragrances. All 3 bar sents are awesome. But this might be the worst bar soap I've ever bought\n",
            "this soap is great. scent is awesome, skin is nice and smooth and no reactions to it at all. i have super sensitive skin and all that i can use is all natural soaps. the Pine Tar scent is strong enough to last on me through an 8 hour shift sweating all day in a factory.  could see using it before hunting to mask my own scent from deer.  the only CON is the sand in the bar, feels like 20 grit sandpaper. don’t try to use the bar around your frank and beans....\n",
            "My husband bought this for himself. I stole it from him. This is honestly the best bar soap Ive ever used. As a woman, Ive tried a lot of skin care and bathing products starting from the age of 4 where I could select my own bubble bath. The soap: it smells so good, it exfoliates, and my skin doesn't feel dry afterwards. My husband went and bought more. Recommend.\n",
            "This is the soap for men who think they are men, but the greatest thing they have ever done is visit all their local brewery.If Axe could make a bar soap this is what it would smell like. One pine bar made the bathroom so over powering with sent I had to call a priest to exorcise what could only be the ghost of Jersey shore haunting my bathroom.I recommend Viking Revolution soap bar, it’s not over powering and great quality.\n",
            "I wanted to try this soap because I am trying to find a quality natural product line to use. I have always used old spice deodorant and dove men body wash, and I get irritation in the under arm area. Having used Dr. Squatch pine tar soap for almost a week now, I would say that I am pleased with the results. The scent is nice, and you feel clean after using it. As far as moisturizing goes, it leaves you less dried out than traditional soaps.Overall I think it is a great product and I would love to try other scents, and potentially other products that Dr. Squatch makes. Unfortunately I can’t afford to buy several other scent or products as the price is a little outside of my range. After about a week of use, the size of the soap bar has reduced to about half its original size (expectedly), and in comparison to other body washes, soaps, that tend to last longer are slightly less expensive.\n"

            "At first I thought the scent was very foresty for me. But I ended up liking the scent. Better scent than the body odor. It does smell like pine sol. If your ok with that then you should be good. It does have rough parts on the soap  but it also exfoliates your skin. Made my skin feeling better and softer. Already ordered another bar of soap.\n",
            "First of all- I will say this is a good soap. But I won't pay 10 dollars for one bar and won't pay 30 plus for a \"bulk shipment\". The day I got it I was pretty pumped to try it after watching the ads for it. First shower I did notice it smelled amazing and I just felt good (this is saying something considering I was just recovering from Covid at the time but I could still smell it quite well). After 3-4 showers I noticed the bar was already depleted by almost a full quarter. I did what most here suggest and keep it high and out of harm's way (water) and was in a dry spot far away from water splash. Now I've had it for about 2 and a half weeks and the bar is practically gone and the smell vanished to basically  nothing. I'm sure it's still cleaning just fine but again- 10 dollars is too much\n",
            "10 bucks a bar is steep....but super worth it.In fact, I just purchased the 10 pack, which knocks it down to 6-7 bucks a bar.It is an all natural soap, and actual cleans, smells great, and makes me feel clean. I was using a body wash from a pretty big/ reputable company, and started to get patches of dry skin from it. So I switched to this and after 3 days, dry skin pretty much gone.\n",
            "This product is for cleaning your body.  It cuts body oils for a deep clean feel without added moisturizers or conditioners.  After showering I feel refreshed just plain clean. Probably not a great soap for sensitive dry skin. But who cares?  That is what lotion is for.  Some people in my family find the pine scent overpowering while the soap is under running water. Well, then they can't use it. It's mine!  If your looking for just plain clean that smells like pine, you found it.A small tiff I have is the shape of the bar. It is a bit too thin compared to its other dimensions so it folds and breaks near the end of its life more than most other bars. It leaves a black residue in the shower soap dish which is a bit unsightly so I just use a separate portable soap container for it.A thicker bar would let me rate this five star.\n",
            "There should be a warning label on this soap!  I used this soap for the first time and my wife couldn’t keep her hands off of me! She kept smelling me and touching me. She let out these animal noises that I had never heard before. This miracle soap awakened some primal forces that were locked down deep inside her. Later once we had returned to the house she quickly locked me away in a hole she had some how dugin the basement with out my knowledge. She lowers this soap in a basket hooked to a rope saying “it lathers with the soap or it gets the hose!!”\n",
            "Bought this for my husband for Christmas, since he hates cologne, I thought this might be an easier, more subtle way for him to smell great.Nope. He smells like nothing when he gets out of the shower. And yes, I have my sense of smell.So disappointing, will never buy again.He did say he liked the soap, he found it fairly moisturizing, but bummed that it didn’t leave a lasting fragrance.\n",
            "This soap is probably by far my favorite soap I’ve ever used. It’s good for my skin, and I feel both squeaky clean and moisturized when I step out of the shower. The only issue I have is that since this soap is cold pressed, it disintegrates much faster than the normal bar soaps I’m used to (I cut it into 4ths and within two days one fourth was almost gone), so you need to keep the soap as dry as possible when not using it. Other than that I highly recommend Dr Squatch\n",
            "I have zero complaints about this soap!!! I stumbled upon an ad for this soap while, watching a music video on Youtube. If anything i bought it, to disprove all the claims made in the commercial, only to prove them all right. I deal with dry skin and get very gross after working. First time after using this soap, i felt like i had a new revitalized layer of skin, my skin was soft and smooth.. plus side being my lady LOVES how i smell.. happy wife happy life right?\n",
            "I gave this soap a try because I'm allergic to most cheap body washes. It helped my skin a lot but anything is better than great value body wash. The ladies have been giving me compliments because it does smell very nice. If you want attention from ladies the commercials aren't lying they love the smell of this soap.\n",
            "The square bar wears down a little funny, but smells great without being over-powering. When you're soft silky lather is all rinsed away you're left with a very light lingering fresh scent. I normally use Dove soap because sensitive skin and moisturizing are concerns for other family members. We all like it, but there was some household debate as to whether the scent is \"manly\" or just \"outdoorsy\" or \"???\". Anyways, I'm happy with this purchase.\n",

            "Let me start off by saying this, I've been watching the Dr. Squatch ads on Instagram etc. The hype was real, but did it deliver? YES, absolutely. When i first received the package I smelled all the scents. Since reviews on youtibe said Nautical Sage was the most appealing I sampled that first. Probably the cleanest feel and smell I've felt in a long time. Thats saying alot considering going through USMC boot camp and loving the opportunity to get a shower. Anyways I'm not saying this product will make women want you but i am saying I dont have a girl currently and i get alot of looks. Maybe its because I smell of beach, a manly beach. Or maybe it's because the added 15 points to charisma this soap gives you.... Either way this is a strong recommendation.\n",
            "The soap was good but some problems. First, the scent was so strong that it affected my asthma and took awhile to get used to it, so not asthma friendly. Second is that the soap doesn't last that long it lasted about two weeks without any \"advance soap life extender\" that they promote for +15$USD. I basically put the soap in a baggy and remove all air and water to try and preserve it, still doesn't last awhile. Third is that the soap has black like follicles that stay on the skin even when I get out the shower. That's all the negatives. The positives is that it does help my beard feel and look amazing. This product would be perfect for a gift not as a daily use due to it being expensive for a bar of soap.\n",
            "I was a beta male my entire life. But after my first use of these soaps my Alpha has come to play and it's absolutely changed my life. Like yea, I'm still fluffy, but damn I feel softer than ever :pOn a real note, this soap is really fantastic and since I first tried it I will never switch back to other cheap crap again. I am now buying the 4 packs to allow me to share 1 with a friend once in a while. This stuff is really that good!Cons: there's only one...I wish the other bars were rough like the Pine Tar. It feels more exfoliating and I love the roughness (pause)Please make them all rougher :pLove you folks!\n",
            "This soap didn't do it for me. I was expecting a nice fresh pine scent to make me feel like I was in the woods but that's not what I got. I don't even know how to describe the scent, but it definitely isn't pine. Whatever they add to make it exfoliate is way too sharp, soap shouldn't be painful to use. And the way it turns the water black makes it hard to think you're actually clean! I'm going to stay away from this brand even though I love their name and ads!\n",
            "You could smell it but not to go \"wow that nice\" it's EXTREMELY hard to make suds. You know like the commercial.  Overall I guess I'm please knowing it's a natural bar of soap but the commercials enhance this soap lathering experience waay to much. I'd buy it again because now I know what to expect and it's natural ingredients.\n",
            "After using this soap I did feel clean... so it works well in that department. Downside... the scent. I smelled the bat before using and smelled no pine... pine is my favorite scent, which is why I bought it. I had to search for it with my sense of smell. I thought,  \"I'll lather up and try anyway. After getting out of the shower, my better half asked if the towel I used had mildew. I said \"no, it's a fresh towel.\" I then smelled my skin and so did she... it was the soap. I wouldn't call it mildew, rather closer to a hint of moldy. I'm not trying to be insulting. Like I said, I felt very clean. The scent is just not as advertised.\n",
            "It was very pungent when I pulled it out of the package, but that died off quick. It cleans fine and does an adequate job; but therein lies the problem. Doctor Squatch advertises their products as the, \"best soap ever\". When you make such bold claims, you had better be able to back them up. This was not the best soap ever, it is simply a soap. Since it does not hold up to the claims made, I give it one star.\n",
            "Its definitely not a miracle soap as others rave about.  Doesnt leave skin moist,  irriates eyes, it runs out quicker than most at 10 times the price.  It smells good, but doesn’t stay on you.  Especially if you have to use skin creme ... and you will unless you are naturally oily.  Skin after feels dry and grabby.\n",

            "I brought Bay rum and Pine tar on 1-13-21 and so I just reviewed the scent bay rum on amazon. I thought that the bay rum was better than Pine tar. But the scent Pine tar does not stick to your skin and the bar of soap has wood chips in it which does not feel good on my skin. Bay rum left my skin smelling like fish, but pine tar left my skin smelling like nothing. At least Bay rum gave off a scent. Old spice is a better smelling product and cheaper than this.The product does make my skin feel clean , better than old spice. The product does clean your skin. If you have acne around certain areas, the soap does feel like it does clean and I do have sensitive skin though.Kinda sad though. Both products bay rum and pine tar was a waste of money.\n",
            "First, I love this product.  I have tried all the bars, and they all smell good and feel good.  I personally like the Cedar Citrus the most, and I think it lasted about 15% longer.  As you may know from the comments this soap doesn't last long.  You can probably stretch them to 5 bars per month.  At $10 a pop, I can't do it. I can buy 8 bars of men's bar soap at target for $6 a pack.  I really want to switch to this soap full time but I cant until they fix their pricing.  Needs to be pack of 3 for $10.\n",
            "It's ok. Doesnt smell bad but I wouldnt say it's a fabulous smell.  Bar melts away FAST.  I can clearly see black water from this bar rolling off of me fast.  I didnt count exactly how many showers I got out of it, but it felt like maybe 20 or 25? I've used other natural soaps before but I've never had one melt away this fast.  The oatmeal is a nice touch to add a mild scratching to rubbing with soap. Probably for the cost, I wont buy more.\n",
            "Really cant beat this soup.Turns out I am allergic to it. Broke out in terrible hives. However I smelled amazing. The EMT who picked me up said she would love to go on a date with a man like me and that is when she epi-penned me to make me no longer look like a leper. The nurse who treated me gave me her phone number and a soft kiss. The receptionist informed me she wouldn't dare give me a medical bill as that is for men who use \"synthetic cleaners\".I am amazed amazon doesn't recommend Trojan as an item people buy when they buy this.\n",
            "This soap is great. It smells and feels great. The only issue, and it seems to be a common one, is that it doesn't last long. Mine lasted less than a month. $10/bar is just too much to spend on soap that doesn't last that long. It's a shame because I really like it, too. Just can't justify spending that much when $2 liquid body wash lasts me months.\n",
            "This soap is amazing! It feels good on the skin and I don’t feel like I’m showering with soap detergent like the other chemical soaps. I tried the Gold Moss and it was amazing. I read reviews and saw the best way to use the soap and I cut the soap into quarters so i don’t destroy an entire bar in one shower session.\n",
            "I was sold on the ads to be honest. Wanted to try something new and purchased the pine tar soap. The worst soap I ever used. It lathers well but the scent is not what I expected. It wasn't strong and could barely smell it once I used it. My wife said the same, couldn't smell it. Try it a second time to be sure and the same. Ended up throwing it in the trash. Will never purchase again.\n",
            "Very good!  I like how it really smells like pine... Not obnoxious like Pine-Sol but a nice, sweet, subtle smell of pine... Smells very masculine for sure.  Don't shave before using this, your beard will instantly pop out after using this soap.The thing I also kinda noticed is how well it lathers up like it finds you irresistible and it really wants to get up all over you as much as possible.Because of this, the bar will last about 2 weeks-ish? I definitely will be buying this again and trying other smells to see if there's another I'd like.Thumbs up from me!\n",
            "This stuff is awesome! My husband’s clothes have always really been smelly after a big workout or even just mowing the lawn. This soap has made all of that odor go away! He even bought the deodorant recently and that works great too. We no longer have to put workout clothes directly in the laundry! Yay!!\n",
            "I don’t have any skin conditions and I was not looking for moisturizing soap. I wanted a soap that left me feeling clean, had a strong scent, and was appealing to my wife. This soap checks all the boxes. As with most soap I have tried, I wish the scent lasted longer. The price is a little high but in my view, you pay more for quality. I went to their site and the price is less but shipping is extra. There are some savings on the site. If you want to purchase enough, you get free shipping. But if you just want one thing without a Dr. Squatch subscription, Amazon may be the way to go – especially if you are a prime member.\n",

            "Bought the sampler pack for my husband—yeah, he loves it! But why does he have ALL the fun?!?! I grabbed up a bar and headed to the shower! I’ve had dry skin and eczema for years, so I thought I’d try the pine tar bar for it’s exfoliating benefits. Wow!! Felt great and didn’t irritate my skin! How can a man feel like a man if there’s no woman around??? Sooo, when are you going to come out with a line for us ladies, huh??\n",
            "I am really disappointed. My product is nothing like the other reviews. Pine tar smells mostly like cardboard with the distant scent of oatmeal and i don't have an aroma after a shower like others claim to have. I don't feel cleaner. It melts insanely fast if It gets wet, which makes it difficult to lather. It does seem to leave my skin a little softer but i wasn't using any special moisturizing soap before so I can't say to what degree it's better. I was really hoping for something nice but after using this product i would not recommend their soap to anyone.\n",
            "I mean really, chunks of oatmeal in soap for exfoliation? Yeah that's manly alright, cause it's something a dumb meathead would do. Leaves my skin covered in scratch marks and you find pieces of oatmeal in unwanted places. Use something like charcoal for exfoliation. Only plus is the scent and lack of that weird residue some bar soaps leave, but the Fred Meyer organic soap brand at half price is twice as strong in scent.\n",
            "It's a nice novelty, but probably not a every day soap. I'm sorry but I should be able to get a month of showers out of $10 bar of soap...It smells great and gets me clean. Honestly that's all a soap really needs to do and while this does that, it seems to melt away at a rapid pace. I have gotten about 2 weeks out of it where as my typical bar of Coast lasts about 6 weeks and gets me just as clean. And I can get a lot of Coast for 10$...\n",
            "Great product.  But this is clearly Soap Guy Soap.  I found soap guy by digging into this soap a little bit and based on some reddit posts. Soap guy soaps can be had for 1.75 a bar so going that route instead as this is great soap.\n",
            "I bought this product after seeing commercials for it thinking it would be a good product to buy. While I can't say it wasn't a good product I will point out that the scent is not very strong and it does not last like one would think that it would. The product itself is exactly what it says it is. The product does have the smell that you pick and the product does do a good job moisturizing. Overall I think that the product was a good product.\n",
            "Dr Squatch Pine Tar Soap is absolutely THE BEST MEN'S SOAP ANYWHERE! A bar of this smell literally smells like a pine forest, and it has a very rich lather that cleans unlike any soap I have ever used! I literally went through one bar of this stuff within less than a couple weeks time and used it right until there was nothing left of it! And it leaves you feeling naturally clean because it contains all natural ingredients with no harsh detergents! I highly recommend this soap to any guy who wants to feel clean, smell clean and still smell like a guy! Get a bar of Dr Squatch Pine Tar Soap and try it got yourself! I guarantee you will be hooked on it from the first time use!\n",
            "You can smell it a little when using it but it certainly doesn't last. Even right after I dry off I can barely smell it anymore. Seems consistent with the other comments I read after purchasing it. I'm surprised they advertise the Pine Tar. Also, it is overly abrasive.Because of how expensive it is, I'm not taking any chances of purchasing another scent.\n",
            "I hope the mfg of this bar of soap is reading their reviews. Here is my honest feedback. When the bar of soap arrived, I immediately read the ingredients. Product management team, what is in the bar of soap that makes it drip black all the way down my shower? Is this black die?Second, the \"pine tar\" smell is seriously overpowering. I have a two year old that still has dirty diapers in our bathroom and the single bar of soap over powered that bad smell with the strong smell of what seemed like \"pine sol\". It was so strong I started to sneeze.Also, the bar seems to just bleed soap after its wet. I am sure you cant help this due to the natural ingredients. I have only taken two showers with it and a sizable amount is gone. Maybe it will last 10 showers?It cleans well, skin feels smooth after, not dry. So that is a perk. And your videos are fun. I would suggest if you really like really strong pine sol smelling soap, go with this one. Hoping it doesn't stain my shower black. There is another review that accurately represents this.Lastly, I would consider a different bar for a next - last chance purchase.\n",
            "I’ve tried five different bars so far and I have enjoyed them all to different levels. Summer better than others and it’s very subjective. The quality is outstanding, the prices on target, I wish they lasted just a little bit longer though. I prefer these soaps to any of the liquid that I’ve used in the last 15 years. I will not stop buying them.\n"

            "This stuff is amazing!! I didn’t think it was going to smell so good and work so well, I was very skeptical about it when it came down do it actually working as a scrub and not leaving my skin dry, when I came out of the shower my skin did feel dry like when I use Irish Spring, but once I dried up my skin was left nice and moisturized, and the smell so so good!! My entire bathroom and bed room smell great haha.Definitely going to try a couple more and get on the subscription!\n",

            "The soap advertisers did a great job! Because here I also bought.It is a nice soap, feels rough on the body, in a pleasant way.The scent is the smell of regular soap but intensified and strong (I bought the black).For some reason, the soap runs out really fast. In my opinion faster than average soap.But he will not make you sexier and your girl will not want to climb on you because of the soap. Sorry.Bottom line- if it was $ 3 soap- I would buy again because it's nice. At the current price - not at all.\n",

            "I generally do not care for the \"all natural\" or organic products fad, but this soap is pretty great. Very nice scent, high quality for a bar soap (I usually dislike the way bar soaps make my skin feel - this soap doesn't have this issue), and I feel really clean after use. My one major complaint is that the soap hardly lasts. You get a week, two if you use conservatively, out of this bar and it costs $10. Not a great value, and likely marked up because of its \"all natural\" marketing. If money isn't a concern and you don't mind the organic fad (or I suppose if you're into that), you'll enjoy this soap. Even if you generally just use body wash or shower gels, give this a try at least once; it really is a quality soap.\n",

Do not buy this scent.Pine Tar: My favorite scent, not as good as my usual big brand body wash, buts it's been growing on me and I like the natural schtick so will take the compromise.Cedar Citrus: My second favorite scent.This is a fine soap, but the price needs to come down eventually if I'm going to buy regularly.  I've been using one of these 3 bars every day for the past 3 weeks and they are all 75% gone.  They don't last long enough to justify the price, but hopefully this changes.\n",

I bought a bunch of stuff on amazon so when this came I wasn’t sure what item it was, but as soon as I broke the seal on the amazon envelope I knew lol. I can definitely see how some people would like this smell, but it smells straight up like urinal cake to me LOL I just can’t shake it. I bought the Butter Rum scent before I even got the chance to return this one because I knew I still wanted to get this soap for him (if you read about the company you’ll find out how great their products are) but dang that pine tar smell was not right for us haha. Butter Rum is still masculine but much warmer and cozier, boyfriend ended up preferring it in the end as well. He said he likes that he smells like it after a shower for awhile and that my skin has competition in softness now haha! We’ll continue to purchase! Thank you!\n",
            "This extremely overpriced soap is totally misleading. 1. Video shows lots of lather and bubbles, I had NONE of eeither. 2. One full bar will last approx 5-8 days. Falls apart toward the end. 3. I left a bar on a soap dish in the shower, without touching it, the bar melted and dissapeared on its own.I have no problem paying for a quality product, however, this is POOR quality! Save your money!\n",
            "So far I’m digging this stuff. I noticed the other stuff I’ve been using was making my skin dry so after running across this, I thought I’d try it. Smells good while in use, but it isn’t overwhelming once your done, so ladies could probably use this without walking around smelling like a lumberjack (unless your into that, and that’s ok). My skin doesn’t seem as dry and I just felt cleaner after going a round with this. I wish it lathered up a little better but got still works. I’ll probably try the 3 pack once I finish this bar off.\n",
            "Well I’m kind of torn on what to rate it. It’s good but it isn’t good good. It’s has some sort of something inside of the soap that scratches the hell out of you and mine completely dissolved and turned to little crumbs after just 2 shows. But those two showers were really good. Skin felt good but definitely not worth the money\n",
            "This is a pull no punches soap does what it says. Smells good but not over powering un any way \"natural\" in every way. I thought at first my bars weren't lasting very long, then I realized how much I was actually using them 😅. I have since learned to put the bar down in the shower and they last alot longer.\n",
            "My teenaged son wanted to try this soap. He chose the pine tar scent. It smells terrible. It reminds me of a scratch and sniff pickle sticker. It was very rough with the chunks in it and hurt his skin. And to top it off, it lasted less than a week. It just dissolved in the shower. He was very disappointed.\n",
            "My main problem with soap is, when I  apply it, it feels great on my skin but as soon as I rinse it off, my skin gets super dry. So I saw a commercial for this soap and they talked about how it wouldn’t leave your skin dry, obviously I had to try it.Let me tell you, I love it, my skin is never dry after rinsing. All the soaps smell great and are all natural. Just be careful in the shower, the suds are slippery. The bar does me about 3 weeks, maybe less if my wife uses it.I’m still waiting for the shampoo and conditioner to come back in stock, would love to try but overall the soap is 5/5.\n",
            "It smells like fresh pine trees. Tho the scent doesn't last too long.It is kind of rough so feels good on your back or itchy areas.But doesn't feel too hard on my skin.I wish a bar lasted longer and was cheaper.Would recommend if you're looking to smell like a man of the forest.\n",
            "I swear to god I love this soap and will continue to buy it. While it is on the pricier end that's what you get when you buy American made products, higher quality always means higher price. This soap will not disappoint though, my only complaint is the inaccuracy of the portion sizes and how long it lasts, it almost seems as if you were **intended** to buy the soap pan that comes sold separately.. despite this however the soap still smells and works amazingly. It is a little scratchy due to its exfoliating nature but I personally consider this to be a plus.\n",

I feel at a price point of almost $10 a bar, I should be getting something that will last at least a month, maybe closer to 6 weeks.So, really excellent product, just not so amazing that I can look past the price per ounce a second time.\n",

            "I bought this soap because all year I seen all these ads hyping up this bar soap saying it smells amazing and the scent lasts a long time and it's so much better than other soaps...total garbage..never have I ever been so taken back on just how god awful a product truly was in comparison to what the ads say it is..the soap kinda smells like the scent they say but only lasts until you step out of the shower from then on it just smells like you washed with a nonscented soap from the dollar tree. Save your money and just go to the dollar tree and buy your soap is what you need to take away from this review.\n",
            "After Seeing All The Ads About This Soap I Thought I’d Give It A Shot.I Just Got It Today And Let Me Tall Ya That It Smelled GREAT It Doesn’t Lather Up To Good Though And It’s Not As Soft As I Expected It To Be.The Smell Doesn’t Stick At All And A lot Of The Soap washed always after One Shower.I definitely won’t be buying this again and it’s a waste of 10 dollars.I’d say it’s worth about 4 to 6 dollars.No more than that.Don’t waste your money\n",
            "The scent of all the bars I’ve tried so far I have absolutely loved ! I used to have very dry elbows and I don’t like using lotion or think about it much. Since I’ve switched to this soap the dryness on my elbows has gone away this stuff is excellent at moisturizing your skin! I would highly recommend this product!\n",
            "Wasn’t sure about this product figured I would try it out. It is expensive I took the recommendation of buying a soap tray and cutting the bars into 4 squares I am on day 8 and one square is almost out it lathers well so using a lot isn’t necessary. As for the smell it smells very good while showering but after that completely gone my wife didn’t even notice the smell while showering or afterwards. I purchased this as it is mentioned that it smells great and last’s this is not the case. All in all it’s ok won’t purchase again for the price I will stick with the Harry’s I use cheaper and leaves a lasting smell after showers on my skin.\n",
            "Despite the really persuasive commercials for this item the smell absolutely resembles Pine-Sol! And Im disappointed. I don't usually write bad reviews, but I am very disappointed. For the price this soap is not worth it at all.\n",
            "This is my favorite brand hitherto by far. I loved the soap, and despite it's notably short extancy, I definitely intend to try other scents and find my favorite. I've tried three so far, and it's definitely a close call. I'd recommend this to anyone, but I'd recommend buying from the shop itself instead of Amazon. It's a bit cheaper.Edit: Usually when I buy a brand of nice-smelling soap, the scent fades as soon as I leave the shower, but I like that even after getting sweaty from work or exercise, I can still smell the soap on my skin. I feel it's definitely worth the price.\n",
            "I love the scent and cleaning ability of this soap.  But thats where the positive ends.  This soap was gone within 5 days using once daily.  I would not recommend this soap because of the high price and the soap only lasting 5 days  I contacted DR. SQUATCH and he did offer a replacement bar free of charge, but i opted for a full refund instead and went with another brand.\n",

I think that's what my body needs.  My female roommate and I both used this and both noticed that we would smell of body odor a few hours later.  Maybe it works on some people but not me.  I used it for a few months and tried about 5 difference scents now.  Pine tar is my favorite.\n",
            "Over all I liked it but I'm a really dirty farmer and it only lasted me 8 showers... I was really disappointed the block of soaps Dissolved so quickly and didnt last long, although I do need to scrub extra to get the grease off..... Too expensive not to last very long...\n",
            "First day I was excited when the amazon package arrived.  I opened the box and my whole house smelled like PINESOL. This soap smells like the cleaners closest.  After my first use I felt like I put this layer of Thompson’s water seal on me. Felt very waxy and water was beading off my body. I guess I was a sucker for the AD. This hippy soap is just a hype.\n",
            "So far the one bar I have used has smelt good and my wife commented on the smell positively. The negative that I am seeing is one in my package must have been smushed so one of the bars came crushed. It’s pretty pricey for just 5 bars/4 for me. I have noticed the bars are going to melt pretty quick compared to others I have used it a couple nights and I’m about half way through the first bar. Would recommend dropping the price point a little bit. Product seems good smells like a mans soap just needs to work out some of the other stuff in my opinion for me to keep buying it.\n",
            "I get really dry skin after showering and this has significantly helped. I can’t say you get any exfoliating feeling while you’re lathering yourself up, but it does smell great and makes you feel refreshed when you get out of the shower. Helps keep my balls nice and clean, which is a plus! Will continue to buy these on a monthly basis.\n",
            "I had super high expectations and was excited about this product. Unfortunately, it smells more like pine-sol than pine tar. Also, I’ve been using it for 5 days and I’d say it’s probably about 60 percent of the way gone. Really bummed.\n",
            "Its soap. It helps clean my butt and the rest of my body.The scent is nice. I have only used 1 bar out of the 3 pack, and so far am enjoying it. I will say that it smells like a lot of other handmade soaps that I have been exposed to. This isn't to say that the soap doesn't smell wonderful, I personally enjoy it more than those \"Scents\" like Aftercharge or Apollo that you get from other companies. The soap smells like what it advertises. It hasn't blown my mind...yet.People talk about how the soap doesn't last very long, which is true, but this is a quality of handmade real soap. You do not need to be aggressive with it, as it lathers very easily.\n",
            "Normal bar soap lasts 3 to 4 times longer than these. They smell great and the exfoliation is useful but for 10$ a bar basically these usually last me about a week and a half as they seem to dissolve rather quickly.Overall great item, would be great if they had a body wash version of this stuff.\n",
            "Ok Dr Squatch. Ive seen the commercials and I thought i would give you a try since this is made for men. Just got home from 14 hours in the fields running fert for crops. Dirty fert/grease/diesel hands. Got them clean with very little soap so impressed! But really guys you need to like triple pack that stuff. I could smell it through the 2 packaged you had it in. This isnt getting anywhere near tsa or drug dogs without them knowing lol.\n",
            "The scent is amazing. However, I hated how rough it was on my skin. In the soap there's some grains/oats or whatever it is and it scratches your skin. I tried washing my face with it and was extremely annoying. Dr. Squatch has a good product but I dont like this one. The cool aloe is my favorite so far.\n"

            "I was curious about these items, the pine tar bar seemed to be the most advertised so that was the one I went with. Initially my wife said it didn't smell to bed but once I used it and the sent lessened it reminded her of more of mildew. Also confirmed by 3 of her friends. I will probably keep it in my trailer when I'm out of town on work, I recommend if you are not single tray different sent.\n",
            "This is great soap. However, I take long hot daily showers, sometimes 2x daily, and used up my bar in just over a week’s time.  At $10 for the bar on here Amazon, spending nearly $40/month in soap is just not an option so I went ahead and got a soapscription from the Dr Squatch website and will see how that goes.  Pine Tar scent is great and I actually look forward to my showers now. Again, the only negative is the product’s longevity, which may be a deal killer for some users.\n",
            "This soap disappears in days! You would think that a decent-sized brick of soap would last for a while, but this stuff dissolved in 1-2 weeks. I tried this out instead of typical body wash, but I’ll be switching back. The bang for the buck with a normal body wash is by far superior to this stuff.Those only reason I didn’t give this 1 star is because it does smell great... but so does plenty of other body washes...\n",
            "Got this because of the overwhelmingly positive reviews and figured id give it a try. The first thing i noticed was the scent, which oddly reminded me of the comet cleaner i use to clean my sink. It wasn't terrible, but just, odd. Next, i shower usually twice a day, after the gym/hospital etc. and this bar lasted only about 8 uses. It does lather very well, but for the cost of this bar, i would need 4 just to make it through the month which is a little expensive for soap. Lastly, it didnt really leave my skin feeling moisturized, it had the typical bar soap skin feeling. Probably a one and done for me.\n",
            "Yeah it smells good makes your skin feel nice and all but it’s so not worth the money. It’s soap for god sake’s 3 bars of soap for $30 I don’t think so. Can find the same thing for way cheaper at my local grocery store. Maybe three bars for $15 I’d be more happy to pay for it, but $30 no way.\n",
            "Everything about this soap is 5 stars. It smells great, it’s cleans great, doesn’t dry out your skin, etc. HOWEVER, there are these little white bits in the soap that make it almost impossible for you to rub the soap on your skin because they hurt. The only way I can think to describe it is it’s like the soap has cat claws mixed in.I use the soap on by loofah or washcloth then use those on my body. The prickly nature of the soap isn’t a deal breaker and I’m sure I’ll order more. But, I wish I could order crunchy or creamy soap because my guess is I’m not the only one that would prefer a smoother soap.\n",
            "Put off at first.  Way too fragrant  at first.  It mellowed out after 2nd use and became amazing.  It exfoliates and sucks out oils and cleans pores.It rinses clean...My skin feels great and not dried out.I'm a believer!!!.  But it is expensive.  Also worth a shot.\n",
            "This soap is amazing through and through. It smells amazing, and after using it for only a few days, my skin is noticeably smoother. The moisturizing and exfoliation this soap provides is phenomenal. I can genuinely say this is the best soap I have used in my life. The only con to this soap, if you would call it one, is it does not last very long. I've had it for 5 days, showering twice a day, and the bar is nearly depleted. For some this may not be an issue, and for me it really isn't either, but I'd like to be transparent with my review. I tip my hat to the people behind this soap because you have done an amazing job.\n",
            "Dislike: pine tar smelled too strong like pine sol floor mopping solution. My wife said it smelled like an elderly care facility. Big turn off. Also leaves a lot of shower scum.Like: nice lather, felt moisturized.Still looking forward to trying another scent tho.\n",
            "I really like the way this soap smells. It left me feeling clean and refreshed after a shower. However I can't give it more than 3 stars for two reasons. 1) it leaves a trail of black soap residue in the shower. 2) it is a very soft soap and as of this review I have been using the soap for about two weeks and the bar is almost entirely gone already. Even though I keep it as far from the water as possible, just the spray and splatter from the shower, along with almost once daily use has completely eat away at the soap. $10 for 2 weeks worth of soap is not worth it.\n",

            "No complaints about the quality of the product, lathers and cleans great. Rinses off completely, and has enough grit in the bar that one could almost use it for wood working (exfoliation). Rather my complaint is about the scent.I've used other pine tar soaps (favorite by far is Packer's) and loved the scent and how soft it leaves my skin. I fell victim to Dr. Squatch's advertising and purchased this product believing they would err on the side of manly scent. They didn't. I thought, coming from a company marketing to manly men, that this would smell like 15 acres of fresh cut pine in a bonfire. I was sorely disappointed. It smells more like I got drug to Bath & Bodyworks by the wife, sprayed with every cologne sample and then passed by the perfume counter of Dillards before leaving. Packers doesn't have the grit, but it has the odor. Who cares about the grit though I've got a shower scrubber for that.\n",
            "I first heard of this company from a video ad I saw. Something drew me to it since I saw that video. When I finally had to make a soap order for the stuff I normally use, I decided to try a bar of this. I went with pine tar because the soap I normally use is also pine tar and I absolutely love the smell. This soap had a very different scent than the other soap I use but I fell in love with it the first time I used it. It has a very nice lather which I've had some poor experiences on the past from other natural soaps. I have sensitive skin and usually have issues with irritation from most soaps but this is one of the few that doesn't. I had no idea this was an exfoliating soap when I first purchased it but it is amazing and the worst thing about it at the same time. I love the way it feels and it did a great job exfoliating my skin. I use the soap for my beard and hair as well and had some hair get caught in the substrate but it wasn't a lot and it was only a minor concern. Dr. Squatch did a great job and I will be using this soap more. I highly recommend this soap.\n",
            "If for no other reason I bought this just because the ads were so incredibly funny and a relief in that making you feel that masculinity is okay. I will never buy Gilette again because of that very reason. The soap works okay, it could be a little less pricey. PRO TIP: Cut the bar into fourths and use one at a time. Keep the soap out of any running water except for when you're lathering up. Preferably lather up a luffe. This will make it last much longer.\n",
            "So, I really like this soap. The smell, how it makes my skin feel, etc. Everything about it is great, except the price. One bar will not last a full month. After about 2 weeks, my bar broke in half and after about 3 there was hardly any left. I’ll admit - I applied liberally, but no more than I normally do with soap bars (I like being clean). I have sensitive skin and it’s great for that even though it can be scratchy when you’re running low. As far as soap goes, excellent. As far as value... that’s another story. I doubt I’ll buy more until one of these bars is in the $4 range.\n",

            "Smells great. My girlfriend loves how it helps clean out her pores on her arms and legs.. She gets little ingrown hairs/pimples on the backs of her arms and legs. This really did help for that. The smells is great but it doesnt really stay with you. I like it, but it is kind of pricey\n",
            "I tried this product after hearing and reading all the hype about it. It's not a bad product per se but really expensive for soap. I also didn't notice any real moisturizing effect. It didn't irritate my skin. I am also unable to verify that women love men who smell like this as none commented on it at all.\n",
            "I initially bought the soap to try it out of curiosity. I wanted to get an exfoliating soap so I ordered the Dr. Squatch Pine Tar Soap. I absolutely love it. I love the way it smells and I love the way it makes my skin feel. The only thing I don't love is the price. Too expensive!! Other than that, it is the best soap I've ever used. Because of this, I'm going to try the other scented soaps.\n",
            "I loved the soap, the smell was fantastic and overall did the job as advertised. One complaint I have is the bar didn’t last a week. At 9+ dollars a bar that’s a lot to give for how long it lasts.  I will definitely purchase again, tho not as often as I would like.\n"

            "My husband actually had to go to the doctor because as soon as he started using this, he began to get a bunch of giant cysts. It was gross, painful, and horrible. The second he stopped using it they went away. It is also very messy and will get everywhere if you're not careful. Would never buy again.\n",
            "Good product, but beware of the aftermath: the tub floor was covered in debris. For several days, we COULD NOT figure out where it was coming from (thinking we had something in the water). Finally realized that all of the gunk in the tub was coming from the soap.\n",
            "This is the greatest soap I have ever used. The pine tar scented bar has oatmeal and pine needles in the bar which make it an excellent exfoliator, it leaves you feeling clean and your skin moisturized, and it smells amazing too! The cedar citrus is less exfoliating but still amazing and smells wonderful. The gold moss bar smells great and doesn’t exfoliate at all so it’s excellent for cleaning your face to remove surface oils before performing your regular face care routine. Amazing brand, and all natural to boot, not chemically mixed bars in a giant eco-destructive plant.\n",
            "The smell and feeling you get after using the soap will make you never go back to those mass produced chemical bars. I read some reviews about the soap not lasting long with misleading pictures. The size is, in reality, more than double that of a standard large soap bar. So unless your showering with the water running onto the soap, it should last you quite awhile.\n",
            "First off dr squatch doesn’t even make the soap they get it from a factor. Dr squatch just uses its boxes. That being said the soap last about 5 showers and breaks apart leaves your skin dry not worth 10.00 a bar way over priced save your money not worth the hype\n",
            "My husband loves this soap, he gets really dry skin and using this soap has helped to change that. It moisturizes and cleans. He loves the smell and so do I. I’ll take an extra shower with him just to smell the pine tar fresh on him. It’s like an aphrodisiac. It’s made a huge impact on our marriage... for the better. I’m not buying anything else for him!\n",
            "For all the praise of the scent, I hardly detected it. When I opened the soft packaging it shipped in, I got a strong impression of the scent, and I really liked it. After you use it the first time, it is VERY faint.  Makes me wonder if they coat the outside of the bar with a spritz of the fragrance. The black bar looks cool, but it creates gray water in the bottom of the shower, which I find kind of off-putting.\n",
            "I don't know what I was expecting from a 10$ hype job bar of soap. After being bombarded with daily ads on Facebook for the better part of a year, I finally gave in and made the purchase. All I really have to say about this product is MEH, nothing special. Neither my girlfriend nor I have any strong feelings towards the smell of the pinetar bar, it's just ok. She wasn't able to pick up the scent on me immediately after I showered, only during the lather. I probably won't be finishing this bar of soap. After 2 uses I've already switched back to the old one.\n",
            "Nice scents but they don't last after your shower. Bar doesn't last long for the price. Not good for sensitive skin-made me itch but it may not have been from this soap. $10/bar? Get real. Men don't pay that for soap that's just as good as safeguard. It was a gift. Would I buy it again? Naw. Hot commercials tho. LOL>\n",
            "all the other soaps used to give me the dry skin itch, i hated using them. but when i saw the add for this soap i immediately  tried it and i am impressed !! so much that ill keep using this soap and only this soap. works good, lather is good and smells great.\n",

I would have never dreamed I would have switched back to a bar soap but this stuff really does work great ... great scent and seems to combat my dry itchy Squatch back lol...This soap is great—TxsJim T\n",
            "Great lather nice scent. Bar will dissolve quickly if you dont use soap saver holder. Really exfoliates upper and lower body well with woodsy scent that lingers on you a couple of hours unless you go out and start to sweat. Need to thoroughly rinse after.\n",
            "The scent on these bars of soap are awesome. Like most bars of soap that are shaped oval, these are shaped square. The only problem I had with the soap is that it only lasted for 5 showers. I do not use excess soap or anything like that. I take a normal shower. But with the price that these are. Only getting 5 showers out of one bar of soap is not good. That equals out to 9.33 every 5 days for a bar of soap. I spent $28 on 3 bars. I would definitely recommend the soap. I would not recommend the price. And the price is what will keep me from being a returning customer.\n",
            "DisappointingLasted 14 days and maybe I showered 2x a few days.Came broken on one of its corners so i lost a bit of the bar before starting but that may have brought it to 16 days.Scent is great but it's didnt last long enough for me.It wasnt stored where water hit it when turning on the shower so I'm not sure if 14 days is a normal thing.Sort of a let down\n",
            "Either my skin is too sensitive or a got a bad bar, the smell is awesome, however the bar doesn't last very long compared to other bars of soap, falls apart too easy, and the exfoliating ingredient (oatmeal? wood?) left scratches all over my legs.  If they could make one with less rough stuff and last longer I would be a user for life but it's just not a good fit for me.\n",
            "Not bad soap by any means; however it is expensive for the amount of soap you get.  For the same price I can get 30 bars of the cheap detergent soap.  But the point of this soap is mostly that it’s more natural.  One bar lasted about two weeks of daily showering.  Would buy again.\n",
            "This was a stocking stuffer for my hubby. It smells great, he liked it. I gave it to him on Christmas and a week later the soap is gone. For a $9 small bar of soap, I was hoping it would have lasted longer than a week (showering once a day).  Oh well, lesson learned - will not buy again.\n",
            "Product smells great, feels great on skin. But for price one bar doesnt last that long. I know that's a common theme for this kind of soap, and storing it away from where it can get wet in the shower and what not to increase its \"lifespan\" if you will. But one bar will only last about 2 weeks or less, atleast from my experience with the 3 bars I bought.\n",
            "Overall, this soap does in fact smell amazing but does not last long at all. The soap is created with various ingredients that give a it an exfoliant ability and because of this the soap deteriorated to nothing after only 4 uses. It also caused itchiness. Very disappointed that it does not last long.\n",
            "So first off I got this soap for my boyfriend for Christmas.I gave it to him a few days early like the 22 its now the 26 its half gone.It smells like soil you would dig up earth worms from this is exactly the smell.All that being said he said it makes his skin feel good and clean so we will try another sent.As long as its better we will buy it but I strongly suggest trying one bar first .\n"

It smells like toilet bowl cleaner or a urinal cake, and I was not the only one who thought  that. It also leaves my skin feeling like I just used hotel body soap. Not good and very disappointed\n",
            "I love the smell in the shower! great scent but I noticed when I rinse & come out the shower I don’t smell it. Pretty much doesn’t stay on you after you rinse but it does have a great smell while showering. Just wished the smell lasted throughout the day on you.\n",
            "I don’t know what I was expecting but maybe a bit more for the price. Nice smelling bar but I don’t feel like the scent stays with you after showering, instead a very understated, clean, and neutral smell thru the day. I bought the pine tar bar, which does leave a little pine tarry looking residue in the tub, prolly due to the charcoal ingredient. Has some nice exfoliating elements mixed in, sand and oats or something. My biggest disappointment was how quick it dissolved for me, a little over two weeks. I like a bougie  bar as much as the next fellow but I’ll stick with a cheaper name brand bar that lasts longer and gives off a more pronounced smell.\n",
            "Woman’s perspective: Bought for hubby. Didn’t notice the smell other than while he was it the shower. The bar only lasted a week and then broke into unusable pieces. It smells alright..but not a good value for the price since it goes so fast. Won’t buy again.\n",
            "This soap is now my households favorite!! I got this for a friend of mine for his birthday and used it also and am beyond impressed. It does exactly what it says it does and smells fabulous!! I highly recommend it especially to any who have difficulties finding a good soap for their man..this is the one!\n",
            "I have sensitive skin and most store brand soaps make me break out in a rash, Dr. Squatch makes me feel like a new man breaking out of a long sentence of dirt and grim! Lathers on thick and cleans up great! Washes off truck grease, dirt and clay, lead and oil, and other stuff! It does the job and makes me smell good too! Ill be buying more Dr. Squatch in the near future!\n",
            "They do a great job on the advertisement for this product. I think its a little over priced. The soap smells good when you use it but doesnt leave you smelling like anything. As far as moisturizing I don't see much if any difference from any other soap and maybe a little less.\n",
            "I doubt that I will buy any more of this. It is very expensive, and it does not last long at all. The scent disappears very quickly, and the bar seems to evaporate in no time at all. Far all the money they spend on advertising, I expected much more from the product.\n",
            "This soap is not worth the money. It was gone in 8 days with 1 person using it. Didn't have a nice scent as described. Didn't moisturize skin. The bar was really light not thick like most bar soaps. Thus $10.00 a week for a so called man's soap is quite pricey.\n",
            "So, as a skeptical buyer, I bought one bar to try. I have to admit I am now a believer. Good lather, doesn't get slimy, smells great and rinses clean. I had been using a body wash gel, but this soap leaves my skin feeling clean and doesn't smell like a perfume factory.\n",

That is using it once a day. I had read multiple reviews stating this same thing, but thought we would try it anyway. I gave it 3 stars due to the fact of the over pricing and it not lasting very long. Other than that it was great\n",

You won't be disappointed. Only one thing. The bar could be bigger. But that shouldn't keep anyone from buying this soap.\n",
            "Excellent Soap! Great scent, lathers easily, rinses easily, leaves me feeling clean! Just priced a bit higher than I am willing to pay on a regular basis. Also, a genius on here recommended to cut the bar in quarters with a fishing line, or a wire like me, as the bar tends to dissolve quickly when left near water.\n",
            "Doesn't smell good, dissolves really quick so you don't get much use out of it, I have sensitive skin and this stuff left me very dry and itchy and ten bucks is definitely too much to be paying for this quality of soap there's better stuff out there for less money.\n",
            "I rarely leave reviews, but felt it was necessary. After receiving ads for this soap for about a year now, I decided to give it a go and try it. I've gone from showering once a day to twice just to use this soap more--absolutely love it. The scent is amazing--my only notes here are that 1-I'm not getting as much lather as others may suggest and 2-it doesn't seem to hold much of a scent past when I leave the shower. I don't mind about either of these, since I prefer to just use cologne over scented soaps.Great product!\n",
            "My wife watched the commercial with James Schrader and shared it with me. It was hilarious and I admit that the ad was the reason I decided to try this soap - I love the soap. It's a bit pricey but I have found a couple scents I love and it seems to be \"kind\" to my skin. Every guy should give it a try...\n",
            "I wanted to like this, but it really isn't that great. When you  first use it I think it's fine, but as it gets wet it is like your holding black ink that doesn't quiet want to wash away, and makes the sink look like someone dropped blank sprinkles on it. In the drain you can see a ring of muck where the soap stuck to the pipes. After a few weeks of use the soap bar absorbs moisture and is not very pleasant to use.Sorry I really wanted to like this but I just can't. :(\n",
            "This soap is ok. I've used other soaps from their brand before and had better results I will say.First, the soap doesnt lather at all. I had to rub the soap on a washcloth quite a bit to get enough soap to wash with.Second, the scent is kinda weird smelling and isnt very strong.Third, it dries out your skin a bit too much.Fourth, I switched to Duke cannon and I'm never looking back!\n",

            "There is a black substance that gets all over on the pine tar. It does rinse away except where the soap sits. Otherwise, it seems to be lasting longer, the smell is ok(not great), washes fine, but I doubt  it's worth the price. Great commercial though. Made me laugh.\n",
            "Really dig this soap.  I actually look forward to bathing now. I got the sampler and look forward to each different experience.I don't know if I have a favorite yet, as they all offer somthing unique. I will say that I like that it doesn't leave residue on me, just a clean experience.  So...I plan on being a regular.  Heck , from the Bay Rum, to Aloe... great.  And Pine Tar...I can get that morning wood fragrance and clean....in the middle of the afternoon.  Cheers!\n"

            "Guys....get this soap.  Its not over-hyped and its not just some cheap scents thrown into a cheaply-made soap.  The bar looks great and soap is very high quality.  It laters well, rinses clean, and leaves your skin smooth but not with soap residue.  The essences are most evident when using the soap, although the scent of course remains afterwards.  I'm going to try these also for shaving and maybe even a quick shampoo just to know.I love this product and will continue to support Dr. Squatch.  Please give Dr. S.  a try....you will not be let down.\n",
            "It's good but to be honest it smells just like the other one I just tried which was meant to be totally different I was expecting a really different scent but it's not. Oh and it makes a mess as the soap lather is black and it get everywhere so I have to rinse the shower\n",
            "The soap was given to me to try for a long standing contact dermatitis rash on my arm. It had been driving me crazy for months. After one shower with Dr. Squatch Pine Tar soap, the itching stopped, and right around a week, it was gone forever. I just bought a new bar for a friend’s mom who seems to have a similar itchy rash. The scent is a bit masculine, but I like it!  I have sensitive, delicate skin. This soap is wonderful.\n",
            "Just an average soap thats just average...There is better stuff out there for lot less money. The soap bar has a rough texture, weird square shape that doesn't fit well in your hand, and it doesn't seem to lather up well. Also, it leaves a black mess wherever you keep it. Idk. I usually don't have to think about drying my bar of soap after every use, but with this I do. Not impressed at all. Almost makes me want to ask for a refund.\n",
            "I can't rate in the quality of the soap as these bars are going to be given as gifts for Christmas and I'm not using them. Unfortunately I have been unable to sample the smells of all the bars because the included spearmint basil scrub is overpowering all of the other scents. Its not a bad smell by any means but I almost wish it hadn't been included just so I can smell all the other bars. Every other package that came with it or was boxed with soap bundle even smells like it. I've pulled the spearmint bar out to see if it helps let the other bars shine. Only giving three stars because I can't smell anything else in the box.\n",
            "I Had no issues with the soap. It lathers great, smells great, and it lasted an average of just about 2 weeks. I shower once a day and I don't get crazy with the lather. The soap and chemistry behind it which ain't much, is perfect but the price per bar of soap is crazy. But hey using this soap a few times a year will feel great I guess.\n",
            "The only bar with \"scrub\" capabilities is the pine tar. Got the 3 pack with a soap, exfoliater, and a scrub. The pine tar was supposed to be the exfoliater. The scrub bar is smoother that a bar of Caress.Smell is ok. Not overpowering, but not enough to make you smell like the soap once you put on your deodorant.Soap is super soft. You can mold it before you wet it. Thus, each bar will last for 3-5 showers.Great idea for the company, but they need to do some work to make this a product I'd use everyday.\n",
            "Smells great and a really cool idea. The pine soap has very large nuggets of something that scratches the heck out of your skin. I am sure it is for exfoliation, but the grains are too large rendering it unusable in my opinion. Even using on my arm hurt. I don't really consider myself to have sensitive skin. The other soaps were great though. Otherwise I would have given 5 stars.\n",
            "This company has some very clever marketing, I'll give them that. But of course, I had to test the product for myself to see if the reviews held up. And to say I'm impressed is a gross understatement.Maybe I'm just embellishing my experience, but these three soaps have really changed my view on bar soaps. After years of using store bought soaps, it was a very nice and much-needed change. Very nice feeling on the skin, the smell was faint after a few minutes but was still a nice smell for all three, and it left me feeling refreshed and recharged after each morning shower. I do wish these were larger bars of soap, but nevertheless, I cannot recommend this soap enough and it will likely be my go-to in the future.\n",

            "I love this soap. Normal liquid body washes always leave me very itchy, not this soap. I absolutely love it BUT........ I spent $10 for a bar which is like twice as expensive as some other good bars of soap, it lasted me six showers!!!!!!! They gotta find a way to either lower the price or somehow make it last longer without buying some $20 soap tray. Because if I continue to use this soap, that's like $50 a month on soap which is a bit much don't you think? Other than that I love it and I might buy it again but honestly I'm more likely to look for a cheaper alternative.\n",
            "The short of it: I've been looking for a go-to soap for awhile, and this one is good enough that I might stick with it. Smells like pine, has a pleasing gritty texture, and for me at least, it's held up over time.The major critique I read in the reviews before purchasing was short longevity. I haven't really had that problem, in my experience. My bar has lasted about 3 weeks so far with a good amount still to go. It's on a rack hanging off the showerhead. If your shower would put the bar in range of water drops constantly flying off the shower, I imagine it would break down faster (another Dr. Squatch bar kept on a different rack has degraded more quickly, but that's not a Pine Tar so I'm not sure it's equivalent).Also important is how it's used. I usually lather up my hands instead of directly using the bar. This exposes it to less water and I think has contributed to its longevity. If you use it directly, the soap in between the solid exfoliating particles is more likely to get washed away quickly, and the bar will break down. That said, one of the major pluses of this soap is the texture. The sand/gritty stuff gives it a rough texture that's useful for exfoliation. Wakes you up a little better than your average, too.Regarding scent, it pretty much smells like pine. Truer to the smell of a pine tree than a lot of other \"pine\" scented products out there, but not perfect. Not quite Pine-Sol levels of bracing, but not as smoothly aromatic as real pine sap either. It's somewhere in between. I think it's pleasant in the shower, but if you prefer subtle scents, this isn't for you. Personally, I like a bit of a jarring in my morning shower, kind of like coffee before I actually have a cup of coffee.Overall, I'm pleased. It's lasted long enough that I'm satisfied with the longevity, and the scent is closer to actual pine tar than other pine soaps I've tried in the past. I would probably purchase again.\n",
            "I loved this soap for the 13 days it lasted. I liked the smell the exfoliating features and how clean I felt. I did not like that a bar of soap that cost ten dollars lasted less than two weeks. I’m gonna try cheaper brand of pine tar soap and see if it lasts longer.\n",
            "Purchased for a Christmas gift. It arrived super quick, I opened the shipping box and was very impressed with the manly scent of the soap. I wish I had ordered more for the other male family members in the house! Neat soap! Cool packing. Smells great. Recommended!\n",
            "The commercials are great, but the smells are so so, the lather is not nearly as good as other natural soaps.  For the size and price nope.  Better stuff out there way softer and smoother on my skin. I gave it a try , giving it two stars because it was not horrible, but definitely felt they oversold and under delivered.  A great way to loose customers faster than you replace them.\n",
            "This soap is very nice. The pine tar scent is my absolute favorite. After a month of use, I did notice the my skin was not drying out like the shower gels I previously used did. They have a nice variety of scents so go ahead an explore them and enjoy your shower.\n",
            "I make it a point to not put a lot of stock in commercials and viral marketing we see every day on various social media platforms. This is one of those products that I kept seeing pop up all over.  I like to read reviews and if it’s a good product, I’ll buy it. Well...this is a great product. Smells amazing, feels great, exfoliates and leaves my skin feeling great. I’m sold.\n",
            "I bought the pine tar, which smelled great out of the package, but that scent didn't hold up. My skin actually didn't smell like anything after I used it. It also left a strange film behind. The bar felt sticky when it was wet, and so did my skin. I'm guessing that's due to the pine tar used in making the soap. Also, the soap has wood chips in it. Very scratchy and unpleasant. Somewhat painful to use. Will not be trying their other products.\n",
            "It's a very good soap. I honestly feel the advertisement is way better than the actual soap. Meaning, I have other natural brands that are noticeably more enjoyable and cost less. These were a gift and I am truly grateful and use them each day till they're gone. They are all natural and have a nice fragrance.\n",
            "Dr Squarch soap heavily advertised for its scent. Although it smells good for natural ingredients in no way shape or form does the scent stay after getting off the shower. I do appreciate its natural ingredients compared to fragranced bar soap. Skin feels clean after use.\n"

I have spent hundreds of dollars buying Dove,Tone,and Yardley London Soaps in the past  20 years .I was not ashamed since nobody cared can you imagine that a Straight Dude using Womens Soap for 2 decades.I know I am not the only one  There are other Real Men out there that wash with Woman soap out of Pure Desperation .Having sensitive skin is a b*****Thank Goodness Brother Jack and his fellow comrades have remember how 100 Plus Years Ago All Food Products And Every Thing That Men and Women Have Created And Invented Was All Natural Thank You History Channel,Food Network,Youtube And last and not lease Brother Jack Haldrup and Crew at Dr Squatch This is the first review I have ever wrote Please read aloud to your employees they are helping to resurrect Real Men who love the all Natural S**** Deuces.\n",

He says it's great for exfoliation and his skin feels great all day. Bonus is the scent just manly enough for him to use I love the smell after he gets out of the shower!\n",
            "I’ll start off by saying this soap smells really good and it has awesome ingredients!That being said, it’s way overpriced and only lasted me 2-weeks. Dr Bronner bar soap (look at the ingredients) is essentially an identical product that sells for $3.50 per bar.Nice Instagram ads... but cut your price by 75% then it’ll be 5-star soap.\n",
            "Love the exfoliating scrub in it and the smell. It was hard to use without feeling like half of it washed right down the drain. And once the bar was half gone it was hard to use.  For the price we'd like to get every bit of it for use!\n",
            "I was excited when I first tried the soap because it smelled great and lathered on better than most natural soaps. I shower daily and each day I felt more disappointed with the product, the scent slowly faded each time after the first use and the soap bar quickly thinned out. After 10 days the bar was so thin, it broke into small, unusable pieces. I wanted to love this soap because of the smell and the natural ingredients, but I expect more from a $10 bar of soap. Waste of money, a bar of soap from a hotel might’ve lasted longer than this.\n",
            "Great soap! just as good as described....the price is unsustainable. Which is unfortunate because it was great for my skin. Every Man Jack was so much more affordable, and lasts a good amount of time, and is still reasonably good compared to normal soaps for my skin.\n",
            "Packaging was simple but my Package seal was broke when I received it..smells pretty good, lathers well.the only thing I didn't like was the (oatmeal) when the little chunks stick out they scratch you.i suggest using your fingernail to knock them off. Moisturizing is pretty decent where I don't put lotion on after my showers anymore.in all a pretty decent product\n",
            "The soap is definitely my favorite. Feels good and the scent is great. Would have given 5 stars but the bar of soap you get is tiny for the price. I take one shower a day, and it barely lasted 2 weeks. On the other hand, I also like the Marlowe soap, which is cheaper and lasted 3-4 weeks. Probably stick to that one until the price comes down on the Squatch soap.\n",

This one is a bit rougher on the skin, it has chunks in it but it's not too bad on the skin.  I've also had the citrus IPA one and I love the scents of both of them.  I can still kind of smell the shower I had that morning when I get back home from work, definitely sticks on you longer than typical soap.  Good experience so far, looking forward to trying the other options.\n",

One of the bars isn't even square. The smell is definitely amazing though. Hoping it sticks around after the shower. Size is the reason I gave it only 2 stars. I just think for $10 a bar they could have been a little bigger.\n",

            "Awesome soap but just wish it lasted a little longer. I’m 6’2” 220lb and after using the bar for 1 week (about 10 minutes per shower) it’s less than half it’s original size. It smells Great and leaves your skin feeling Clean and Smooth!Only recommendation to Dr. Squatch is make it last longer considering we’re spending $10 a bar!\n",
            "I ordered soap from Dr squatch directly but it has a long shipping time (due to covid traffic) so I also ordered 1 bar off of amazon. The bar from amazon had full oats in it and smelled very chemically, more like the pine sol cleaner than anything else. the soap hurt to use cause of the big sharp chunks of oats and had an unpleasent smell for a body overall. The \"same\" soap arrived from dr squatch directly and it was much better. ground oats and smelled much better, no chemical smell and does not hurt to use. Not sure what the discrepancy is between the soaps but they aren't the same soaps.\n",
            "This bar of soap smells really good. So in that aspect, it was great. The bad part about it is that it was gone after about 15 showers. We even got the little stand that you put it on to keep it from getting all gross and slimy. There wasn’t even time enough for that to happen, it was gone so fast. We aren’t generally bar soap users so maybe this is normal. But if 15 showers is normal for a bar of soap, we will never be bar soap users.So I would recommend this for the smell, but it doesn’t last very long.\n",
            "Was honestly a bit skeptical because of the advertisements though they are funny; but honestly really great soap. Me personally didn't know how I would like the pine and scratchy-ness of the pine tar soap bar was a pleasant experience and liked it. Scent was also great.\n",
            "The scents are excellent, the soap did leave my face a little dry (I've always used bar soap for my entire body to include my short hair).  The smell was great, the only bad thing I have to say is the soap doesn't last long (7 days using every day) and it's price point.  Averaged about $8.50 per bar on Amazon with prime, I did see this soap on their own website for $7 each and free shipping over $40 however I wanted to give it a try before I purchased that many bars.  Expense and longevity would be my only negative to say about the soaps.\n",
            "I loved the smell! I also love how smooth my skin is becoming all my other shampoos were okay but I have seen a big difference in how smooth my skin is. The smell stays with you all day and the ladies like it ;). the only thing I would like to be changed is that some of the scents are a little scratchy but they are not that terrible. Forget oldspice dr. Squach is where its at.\n"

            "It ok, smells pretty good-reminds me of playing ball. It cleans real well too, but it’s expensive, and I believe a marketing gimmick. It’s not worth $10 bucks with the promise to feel like a man. You’re better off buying a bar of good ole Irish spring. It’s black and leaves a mess on the soap holder and down the wall. Try it, you’ll see\n",
            "Product smelled amazing and made my husband smell wonderful, even hours after his shower I could still smell the soap. The thing I absolutely hated the most was how bad it stained my tub. Every time he got a shower I had to wash my bathtub. Whatever made the soap black was a terrible idea. Also the whole pieces of oatmeal was a bit odd as well. Usually they’re ground up a bit more.\n",
            "I was all hyped on this soap. It is a fantastic soap, but it is not worth it. It just does not last. If I use it conservatively, one bar lasts me 2 weeks. That is outrageous. The smell is good when you're using it, but doesn't stick to you once you wash it off.\n",
            "I love this soap. It smells so good and makes my skin feel great. I feel silky but not greasy. The commercials aren't kidding. My balls feel awesome after scrubbing with this stuff. I have a pretty big beard too and I got rid of my old beard wash and conditioner to use this stuff. My face and beard feel so soft and soothed.Some reviews say it doesn't last very long but I keep mine out of the water when i dont need it and its been lasting pretty well. Definitely got my money's worth considering I don't have to buy additional beard wash and conditioner.\n",
            "Was displeased with the soap. Doesn't last long, not as fragrant as others.\n",
            "Dr.Squatch ads may be corny but this natural soap is worth it. I bought pine tar scent & regret that choice but the soap itself is the best you can buy.The pine tar scent reminded me of cheap car air freshners but my skin feels better than ever. The bar size was also small compared to the price.I will buy again but definitely will pick bay rum next time!\n",
            "Smells like the soap really good love it. Will buy again. Does it moisture ...idk i use cream for skin still because no soap can make the skin look yung and fresh . This soap feels good tho clean compared to those other bars\n",
            "Sorry but it’s not all cracked up like they claim it’s supposed to be.  For the money they get for this soap it isn’t all that impressive.  Soap go’s very very fast if your lucky maybe 2 wks.  It does have lots of scent but the scent really doesn’t stay on you for long. I just don’t see $9 being what it’s worth, $6 maybe but not $9\n",
            "Night and day better than a lot of the different soaps for men out there. As for the out of the three, I like the Pine Tar version the most.Out if the three though, the Pine Tar did stain my shower and it's a pain to scrub the residue it leaves behind, which is why I gave it a 4 star rating.This may vary depending on the materials used in making your shower, mine is mostly plastic and it definitely sticks to it.\n",
            "my boyfriend has sensitive skin and is always itching after showering using the body wash we had. He read the reviews on this soap and everyone raved about the scent.  Lies. The scent isn't amazing but it is natural and clean.  It does not itch his skin but The scent doesn't stay on his skin out of the shower.\n",

            "Was hyped up believing what i saw thru the ads were true and for sure to work but used it for about 3 weeks and was really disappointed that the smell/scent didn't stay on me. Sucks because i came from the axe brand(too many harsh chemicals) where the scent actually stays on me for half the day where as this was gone right after I'd shower 🙁\n",
            "I mostly just like the ads for Dr. Squatch.They're entertaining. They kinda drag the jokes out a bit in the follow up email.The soap didnt seem to lather as well as the male model proclaimed during the supposedly candid beach interviews but I like it anyway.I mean, it smells good, and its soap.And its chemical free.Maintain that sperm count.\n",
            "Per my husband: - Has already been using natural products before trying this brand. The marketing from the commercials which are great, did it for us both. His only issue with the soap is that is breaks easily after the 5th use. Started with the corners and began to crumble from there. If it would of crumbled we would of gave it 5 stars, so we gave it a 4 star review. We’d consider buying again but will try something else in the time being.\n",
            "It smells great, and exfoliates wonderfully, but it lasts for about 6 showers. The entire bar of soap. After 2-3 showers it was about half the size that it was when I bought it. I assume it shrinks so fast because it's made of mostly oils, but I'm not sure. It seems to shrink as it sits in the shower. I'll use it, and it'll be relatively the same size, and I'll come back the next day to find it much smaller. It is definitely not worth the price solely because you can only use it a few times. Maybe if I was rich and were able to spend $10 a week on soap I would buy this again.\n",
            "I bought this for my husband to try as he always felt itchy after showering. No matter where we went-well water, city water, hard water, soft water- and no matter what kind of soap we switched to, he always hated showering because of the affect it took on him. So far he has used the Pine Tar bar and been so impressed and itch free. Praise Jesus he finally enjoys showering!\n",
            "Ok I like the soap but... For the price I would expect it to last longer. I'm 5 showers in and it's already pretty much gone! Would not recommend! Would only do for a \"gift\" not a routine soap, highly disappointed!\n",
            "I like the scent. I love the marketing. The soap works so much better than body wash.None of that matters when a person lives on a small budget.If I had about $500 to spend on soap annually, I would buy this soap.But, I dont have much disposable income. So, I will have to stick to body wash. One regular size bottle of Axe or Old Spice lasts me about 2 months, or 60 showers.This bar is almost gone and it's only been 6 showers.I will miss this kick butt soap.\n",
            "Love the smell and aggressiveness of this soap.  It's a man's soap.  Just watch the sharp oatmeal in the black bar.  It will get ya. Cut my leg open.\n",
            "I stepped out of the morning shower after lathering up with Pine Tar in a rush to head for work and had to literally hold my sweet love at arms length to stop her advances. I smelled so delicious and manly I was a litttle apprehensive to go to work for fear of being attacked by beautiful women wanting at bare minimum a quick sniff. The suds and scents of this ambrosia envelope you to provide a new level of satisfaction in bathing. Dr Squatch doesn’t chafe my sensitive skin, cleans the unmentionables and leaves me feeling masculine. Get some!\n",
            "I am pregnant and having constant itching. My doctor recommended I get Pine Tar soap and I chose this brand. The smell is INCREDIBLE and so far it seems to be helping me with the sensitive skin! Will keep this in stock always!\n",

I am not taking away from those products.....but I will give it to Dr. Squatch.  By far my favorite bar of soap.  Hands down.  The peppermint conditioner and shampoo is excellent as well.  Rub that conditioner in your head and in two minutes you scalp feels like a fresh peppermint patty.  Besides feeling cleanly and barbaric simultaneously I also got the one thing desired with hygiene products.  The compliments.  Received multiple nods from various women presently.5/5  Great stuff\n",
            "Great soap but if you bathe every day expect to go through it like a fat guy through the gravy section of a Golden Corral. Its not milled so it dissolves quickly. It will melt off the neat block of wood that you can get with it. Typical hipster product. Fashionable but not functional.\n",
            "I was skeptical....But.  After using the soap, it's like your taking a shower with your lovely lady in a pine forest summer rain.  It really is Amazing soap.100%, 5/5 stars.  Will buy again and again.\n",
            "After watching so many ads on Facebook and YouTube I decided to buy the soap on Amazon just to try it out. It lives up to the hype. Best bar of soap I have ever had smells amazing feels great not too rough just right and it's not for sensitive skin since  it has beats to scrub your body.\n",
            "Great smell, however... in the ads the soap is made to look huge. When I got my soap I was like... where is it!?! It was a small bar and it disintegrated quickly. Again, the smell was great but I wouldn’t buy again. I was disappointed to say the leasr\n",
            "I’ve been debating on buying this soap for a good 2 months or so because of the price. But I gave it a shot and was pumped when I got it. However, it didn’t last all that long. I shower daily and it was gone in a week. I love the soap and it does an awesome job but not for $10 a week.\n",
            "I bought this soap because I gave in to the heavy advertisement on Youtube. Sure it is manly but it only lasted about 5 washes before the bar cracked in half i pressed it together and got 2 more washes out of it. Nice soap but not worth 10 bucks for a week of showering.\n"

Would love to always use products like this but with bar I got would be lucky to get 4 showers from it and at roughly $2.50 a shower in soap it's not what I was hoping for\n",

I also always disliked a lot of the scents - they all smelled the same and would leave me smelling like a bad mix between an Abercrombie and Fitch and a bottle of Clorox. I tried a number of different products and solutions over the years, but nothing seemed to work quite right or was too expensive. I saw your adds online, and thought I'd give it a go. After about a week or two, I started to notice a real difference. Your soap and hair car products leave my skin and hair feeling and looking great! Also, the scents are fantastic! Dr. Squatch is great and I definitely recommend your products to anyone who wants to make a difference for their skin and hair!\n",
            "It's a bar of soap marketed to men.  It does its job.  The soap itself smells good, but the scent is barely noticeable out of the shower.  Is it worth the $10 spent on it?  Absolutely not.  $10 for 1 bar of soap is a lot of money.  If I paid $3 for it, I'd probably give a bit higher rating.  For the money, You're better off with your basic bar of Irish Spring.\n",
            "The actual bar smells great.. but the 5 min the smell lasts on you is eh. Wanted to try it, now that I did I probably won’t re purchase. Also, the pine tar has flecks of wood (by design) that will scratch your skin. Fun idea .. probably not thought out very well\n",
            "So far, so good.  Great starter package to figure out which one is best.  Not too much of a fan on the \"cedar citrus\" nor \"gold moss\"but the wife LOVES the \"PINE TAR\".  Skin feels and smells very clean and this soap does not over dry.\n",
            "Honestly it’s a good soap, my 2 complaints are the following1. the fact that it’s black and the black suds was getting all over my shower and I needed to rinse it down quickly.2. The cost is a little ridiculous.  I was expecting some real amazing soap for $10 for a bar, but this is clearly a $2 bar of soap.  This company should be concerned on their price point. Def way to high.\n",
            "For $10 you would think there would be some endurance to it. It literally turned paper thin after 2 showers and disintegrated on the third one.Sure, it smells delicious but way overpriced and under delivered\n",
            "Best soap I've ever bought. Bar none. (Pun intended)Seriously. It's 100% worth the money. Probably best to buy more than just 1 or 2 at a time though, and keep them out of the water, because if you don't, they disintegrate. Otherwise this is my new soap from here on out.\n",

            "I purchased this for my hubby because of the funny commercial. (Great marketing crew.)However, it did smell wonderful and leave his skin soft - the bar only lasted him a week or two. (Showering once a day) It dissolved fairly quickly.He did enjoy the soap but it didn't last long enough for the price.\n",
            "1 bar of soap cost me $10 and lasted a week and a half from 1 shower per day. After using I would keep it in a container away from water. Despite that, it still didn't last very long. I won't be buying again since I don't want to pay $30 per month for soap. I recommend TheSoapGuy because you get the same soap for $3 per bar.\n",
            "After seeing the advertisements countless times I decided to give it a try with the three pack sampler.  So far I'm liking the change.  I've been using Pine Tar for just about a week now and I'm not sure that any improvement in skin quality would be noticeable after decades of using liquid soaps, but I can confirm that it smells great and leaves you feeling clean.\n",
            "I have used this Dr. Squatch soap bar for about a week now and it does clean very well. However the scent doesn't stay after showering. Works very well on sensitive skin.  Another down side the soap bar does melt if not stored correctly. you can simply purchase the soap holder for 21$ from Dr. Squatch' main website. This apparently makes the soap bar last 10% longer. I am willing to try other scents. The scent I purchased was Pine Tar. It has more of a tar smell vs pine but smells good.\n",
            "Pretty great stuff, smells nice. My minor complaints are that the soap is shaped differently than almost all soap containers for travel (gym) and that the soap does not last long (2.5 weeks give or take). The natural scents are fantastic and the chemical free aspect is why most will reach for the squatch. Good for those with skin conditions\n",
            "It dissolves very quickly, like 10 days. It has actual pieces of wood in it and isn't very woodsy. There is a kinda slimy layer as you use it; that means lots of fast dissolving fats and oils in a 13 bucks for a little bar of soap.  I wanted to like it, but there are SO many far better soaps than this.\n",
            "I bought the pine tar soap and don't get me wrong, its good for exfoliating, but naturally it will dry out your skin. But it's WAY too expensive and the scent was brutal. Pine tar is like Pine-sol's offensive cousin, and just stings the nostrils. Idk if mine was just a bad batch, but it also looked nothing like the picture, not that the looks of a bar of soap matter. Mine looked like a goth oatmeal cookie.One 5oz bar for 10 bucks? I just bought like 3lbs of Shea moisture African black soap for like 27 bucks and it smells gd delicious. And it'll last me forever.\n",
            "Boyfriend has a dry patch of skin on his wrist that we just cannot get rid of, no matter what we use.  This stuff is actually getting rid of the dryness finally!  Only downside is he's going thru the bar crazy quick!\n",
            "Wow this soap is the shi!!, it smells great the only problem I had was it dried my skin but that was just me .\n",
            "I purchased the pine tar scent about a month ago. I really loved the scent as it was really refreshing. I used it for about 2 weeks until it conpletely used. I thought it was a good deal!However after giving it some thought, spending $10 for a small bar of soap is definitely not a bargain.I recommend that if you like the scent of this brand's soap, use them occasionally and have a cheaper alternative soap for daily use. Perfect for date night!\n"

            "I bought this soap because I had seen it advertised almost everywhere I looked. And so, I said to myself, “I wanna smell like a man too!”I bought it, showered with it, and I can now say that I smell like a man.One thing I did not count on, was that the oatmeal in the bar of soap would be so sharp! It literally scratches at your skin and leaves marks. It was painful!But then I told myself “Come on! You’re showering like a man now! Of course it hurts! Why wouldn’t showering hurt, just like everything else in a man’s life hurt!?”So, suck it up. You smell good. Your skin is exfoliated. And you feel like a man. What else do you want?\n",
            "Very little pine tar. Smells like other fragrances, which, from reading reviews some people will like and some will not. Personally I like the more pine tar smell and the effects it has on the skin. One bar lasts a very very very short time. Poor value. I stuck my previous sliver of a bar of other soap to it and the tiny sliver lasted as long as this whole large bar did.I do like how it smells though. Even though it doesn’t smell like pine tar.\n",
            "Love the smell of the pine tar. Lathers well and scent lasts on the body. However, the bar itself doesn’t last long at all. One bar got me maybe a week and a half. I felt the soap was overpriced for a normal bar of soap to begin with. But what you get is almost half the size of a normal bar, that disintegrates twice as fast, and is triple the cost.\n",
            "When you purchase them through the Dr squatch company they come with a plank of wood to store them on, which I assume absorbs the moisture and keeps them a bar of soap longer.They last about 2 showers because they melt unless you store them out of the shower.\n",
            "I actually loved the smell of this stuff and that it is all natural. The problem is that the bar only lasted a week and a half. I can’t afford to be spending $30+ a month on body soap. If it is something that you feel is worth the price you’ll probably love it. Again, absolutely love the product and would get more but I can’t justify the price.\n",
            "I would have thought for the price that the soap would last a while, my husband used it and I think he got 10 showers out of 1 bar of soap.\n",
            "I tend to get really itchy spots where clothes rub.  This soap ended that.  Dry skin on body is gone.  This soap did dry my face out a bit.  Great smell.  A little on the pricy side, but, it works great.  Great lather and I feel really clean after a shower.\n",
            "Smells great, but does not last. My husband really likes this soap, but it is noticeably smaller every time he uses it and he is a shower every day kind of guy. We have only had the soap for 4 or 5 days and its definitely half the size it was originally. Way too pricey to only last about a week per bar.\n",
            "Each of these soaps lasted me 5 days... tops... in southern Arizona hard water. I paid $26 before tax. Compare that to a whole month of Dove at $13 a package. So I pay twice as much, and it lasts 1/4 of the time. I don't know if I can afford that.\n",
            "Lasts about half the time as other soap if kept dry. Costs about 4 to 5 times more. Leaves my skin dryer actually. Scents are nice and I like the whole natural approach. I feel the same amount of clean but I just can't justify spending that much again without noticing something better than the soap i was using before.\n",

Also buy a soap holder / thingy so it prolongs the life of your soap.\n",

            "Not a fan of this soap.  It’s severely over-priced for the quality of product you receive.  The scent isn’t the greatest and it doesn’t last long at all.  You can get MUCH better results from soaps that cost 1/3 of the price.  Won’t be buying this one again.  Save your money and don’t buy this.\n",

I don't have dry skin but this soap sucks my moisture out making me feel like I need to bathe in lotion. The bar goes pretty quickly I have soft water so sudding isn't a problem for me\n",
            "Overpriced hype.  The bars have this piece of hard bark that scrapes your skin.  I used it twice and returned to the stuff I used before.  Reasonably priced and works.....  I will not recommend this to others.\n",

            "So after reading up on the product I felt it was worth a try, especially being a supporter of small businesses. Concluding after trial of this product and I must say I’m a detergent loving soap person. This soap smells terrible even though my wife lied to me on how appealing it was until I ran out of soap and went back to old spice did she compliment me on how great I smelled. I’m her words “wow you smell really good not like your old soaps you used. I had to cut her off and let her know I’m using old spice again and that’s when she was honest to me and said it was a horrible smell the pine tar smells like nothing I have ever used and won’t again.\n",

I had the pine tar, it scratches while using it, imagine using a loofa to scrub yourself down. Or using a rock covered in soap. Not worth 11 bucks. Cool product, cool marketing. You got me. Once! Smells totally different when using. Thought the scent would have lasted longer on the body after you use it.\n",
            "I was excited to try this soap, very but very disappointed. I don’t know if I got a bad badge but this bar has no scent whatsoever other then a candle wax or boil oatmeal.So much for natural oils.\n",

            "I decided to try out the soap after deliberating awhile and seeing reviews. First impression: smells pretty good...a little synthetic smelling (despite 'all natural' ingredients) but good. Love the texture, rinses clean.The problem is that it lasted me maybe 6 showers. I don't take long showers. I used a soap dish. It wasn't sitting in water. I could practically see the bar dissolving significantly while using it. Maybe I got a bad batch, but based on my experience, I'd give the purchase 1.5 stars, but 2 stars will have to suffice.\n",

            "I love this soap and the sent. I purchased every different bar at once looking for my go to smell and feel, I love them all.however, when watching an add for this or a pic you come across the bar looks to be a big bar like a duke bar for example. ( sorry for the reference ) but I was very disappointed by the small size of the bar after paying so much. best example, the bar is smaller than a standard bar of soap, or the same size just a different shape. for the price I was expecting at least close to twice what it is after all the pics and commercials.I love the soap but I cant say I would spend that much again.\n"

Well that is true... however the small cubes will melt super fast unless you store them in a soap container. Left out, even far away from water this soap will degrade and melt right before your eyes. I decided to try some African Black Soap, you can get a pound of it for the same price, made my skin feel better and at least lasted me a month even though it melts faster then a normal bar of soap such as Dove. Id try it out but it will melt way to fast for the price tag.\n",

            "The bay rum as well as pine tar was not for me, smelled great but just wasn’t for me,On the other hand the Nautical Sage by far is great skin feels great, great scent, and moisturizing as well as cleansing without all the harmful mess looking forward from more but so far the sage is where it is at for me the bay rum dried my skin more than what I needed the pine scent wasn’t pine tar for me  but eyy sage is great!\n",
            "This scent particularly was not the best & compared to the old spice my husband has used for the last 6 years before switching to this we both definitely prefer the old spice . Not only did we not like the scent but it definitely doesn’t last very long at all & by the time he got home from work he needed another bath because you could smell the funk on him which never happened before he switched\n",
            "This bar of soap changed my life, I've never felt so clean before. let me start off by saying I was using dish soap before I found this. I'm glad to say I gave them the easiest 5-star review ever. Another great thing about it is that it makes the bathroom have a great scent 24/7 (I got the pine one).  I would recommend this to anyone!\n",
            "Worst soap I’ve ever bought1) it smells like a abandoned hospital2) it’s so small3) I washed my hands and saw it’s half used4) it dried my hands5) it’s so overpriced6) I wouldn’t even offer a homeless this7) a dead dog smells better8) I can’t get the small out9) false advertisement10) smells so badOhh And I think I forgot to mention it smells like a skunk but way worse\n",

Not the pine tar I am used to. 6 showers later, the bar is about half as big as it originally was. Kept well out of the water, it noticeably shrinks every use so far. My skin feels no different, and if anything is drier now after using it than with any other soap I have. For $10 a bar.....pass. I'm sure the other scents are good, but if you're looking for a lasting, pine tar soap bar....pass this one up. Not at all worth while.\n",
            "I think it's a great product it certainly shows on my skin the only downfall is when the soap starts to get thin it'll start to break up so you have to clump together as a ball to get the most out of it\n",
            "It smells amazing and feels really good on sensitive skin. After the shower my skin felt great! Only downside is how expensive this product is for how long it lasts. 1 bar lasted about 8 days after taking a shower every night.\n",
            "I like it but I’ve had it for about a week now and it’s half gone. Reading the reviews it said the soap can’t get wet or it will disintegrate. I’m in the shower so naturally it gets wet... I more than likely won’t buy again, but if I was to, I would buy something other than the pine one because it also leaves a nasty black ring around the tub\n",

            "honestly the hype of this soap is over rated. it does have somewhat of a good scent while in the shower but that's about it. after a few uses the soap starts to crumble into little pieces a clogs the drain. I'd say it last me about a week of usage. I wouldn't buy again\n",
            "Smells really good but looses the scent in a few days, still smells a little each time you use it. Hubby really liked it he’s had it for 2 weeks and showers daily it’s placed far from stream on top of a soap saver\n",
            "Smells great !Should last longer than the perfumed & creamed soaps.Keep imagining_ \"I wonder if the Sasquatch, Big Foot people would be attracted to the woodsy smell ofPine Tar or, the Cedar Bar of soap\" ?\"Can't see them washing their fur. that would take a whole Bar.\"My daughter-in-law has a Oh, no look on her face.Forget, that_ it's for my Son.

I have greasy sweaty skin and often with soap from the stores I have to wash twice to actually clean my skin. With this “pine tar” I only had to lather up once. I love it. It was like a Maui tai shaolin monk came in K O’d the nasty off me and then covered me in a blessing scent. Gave me some words of wisdom and boosted my spiritual confidence then sent me on my adventure with a bottle of the finest water in all the lands.Yep that’s describes it perfectly.Great job doc!\n",
            "I've used many different liquid and a few bar body washes over the years. After first use I felt a difference. The feeling after is very different than versus luffa and body wash; feels \"clean.\" As in the description it lathered with little effort. The texture feels great and is surprisingly gentle. After a few more uses, I believe this will be about two bars a month purchase. Now keep in mind that it is cold process soap and I kept it away from the water on an upper back shelf. Overall, that's not bad, especially since you can save money by subscribing.\n",
            "My husband won't stop raving about this soap after getting a bar for Christmas. He says he feels cleaner and softer then he ever has before. Its exfoliating, and has cleared up the skin around his shoulders. I got the pine scent, its very strong in the bathroom when its being used, but its really subtle on the skin when he gets out. We're getting more after this bar runs out.\n",
            "Was gone in two weeks.  Not worth the price to barely last a couple weeks. And was used by one person.\n",
            "My husband was so excited to get this as he rarely ever gets adventurous with his shower regiment. Awful, he broke out almost immediately and it made his skin extremely dry.\n",
            "The fragance is outstanding! All 3 of them! I noticed that 8 hours after shower I can still smell it on my skin. They leave a pleasant scent that females feel very attracted to, trust me, I got reviews from them lol. The only reason these soap bars are not getting a FULL 5 Stars is ... because their lifespan is kinda short if you use them everyday! If, somehow they can make them last longer, they will definitively get a 5 Star rating.\n",
            "Not exactly sure what this product is doing, but my gf just asked me to order some for her. You be the judge. Happy showering. But seriously, I have had a mysterious after showering allergy for years. I've tried all kinds of products. This soap worked after the first try. No itching for me. I plan to share with my cousins.\n",
            "I love the pine tar scent. However i was recently discouraged when i ordered some. Upon adding it to my order on Amazon the quantity option i selected said one, but in the scent selection drop down menu it displays a 5 pack and clearly say 5 pack in the upper right corner with a picture of 5 bars. So as you can imagine it was a bit of a let down when selecting a quantity of two five packs as stated in the description, and only receiving 2 bars.\n",

Dr. Squatch claims they last about 4 weeks.\n",

I initially ordered from the actual site, but there were some awful shipping issues and I couldn't wait any longer so I bought from Amazon. Their customer service was great regarding said problems, I'm just impatient. Now, we have an abundant supply and I won't be buying anything else. I even use it. Highly recommend.\n",

            "Good smell, but this happens to be the first cosmetic thing that I’ve been allergic to. Didn’t realize that I was itching like crazy after the use of one of the soaps. I’ll try the others but I’m not expecting much.\n",
            "After many months of seeing ads and putting off trying these soaps I finally purchased a bar via Amazon vs direct from Dr Squatch. I’ve had this bar and for only four days (used only by me and taking a couple showers a day) and it’s shrunk down more than 75%! I’m following the instructions, by keeping it dry after use and also having it drain when not in use and not sit in water.I can buy a small bottle of Dr Bronners for the same price and it last me three months. Quite disappointed, but maybe I got a bad bar or something.\n",
            "My husband loved this soap! He said it was better than any body wash he’s ever bought. The natural fragrance was very unique and he said it definitely gave the “clean feeling” without the dryness. As his wife, I really liked the black bar which was (pine tar). Yummy!😋\n",
            "Nothing about this product is bad as far as the way it smells, cleans, and looks...but for nearly 10 dollars for ONE bar of soap, it should last longer than a week and a half...and I take a shower every other day each week. It also wanted to break apart into big chunks the smaller it got, which made it very difficult to clean with the last couple of days I was using it. Eventually the rest just all went down the sink.I'm not sure if I'd buy again unless they dropped the price to maybe half the cost of what it is now for one bar.\n",
            "While I did enjoy the scents, this soap destroyed my skin, not sure if I just have sensitive skin but after using, my skin became very dry and itchy and almost painful to stretch the skin. They claim to guarantee it but when i contacted them I never heard anything in return. Additionally, depending on how you use the soap it does not last very long. Overall, this product did not meet my standards and would have liked a refund so if you tend to have dry skin I'd would steer clear as they don't honor their guarantee.\n",
            "My husband uses Dr Squatch only now. He loves the different smells as do I. It has helped his skin and keeps him moisturized all day. Now they just need a woman's product out there.\n",
            "Scent was great, but the larger size doesn't make up for how fast it dissipates.  I have a really good (perhaps the best) angled soap-bar drainer/drier soap-holder out there, and this bar still just leaked itself away.Perhaps it would be better if a user dried his bar of soap off with a towel after every use?\n",
            "All in all, it’s ok. Scent doesn’t hang around for too long on your skin after you shower. The bar of soap itself disappears FAST! I can relate to other reviews on here. I got about 10-12 showers out of it. Considering it’s a $10 bar of soap, you can say you spend a dollar almost every time you shower. Trying Duke Cannon now. It’s like $1 more, but twice the size, or more! So if it lasts twice as long, you’re spending 1/2 the money in the long run! We shall see.\n",
            "LOVE the smell!  the sand is really abrasive, like REALLY abrasive.  i like it though, it's getting off all of the dead skin!  this product is expensive seeing as i'm not sure i'll even get 10 showers out of the bar, but it's something i'll use when i'm treating myself after a long day.again, the smell is amazing.  does not linger on the skin, but every time i'm in my bathroom it's fantastic, even if i'm not in the shower\n",
            "It had something that looked like woodchips mixed into it. I'm guessing for abrasion??  I dunno if that was ment to be.  It felt kinda of rough.  I did like the soap felt and left my skin. But I'm shooting for another scent.  The soap bar does wear out fast!\n"

            "One of the best natural soaps I’ve used!  The smell is amazing.  Most natural soaps are either smell like some form of women’s perfume, or have no smell at all.  I get out of the shower now with a hint of true nature.  I also love this soap does not leave my skin feeling dry or itchy.  This is so important, especially since the weather is starting to get colder.One complaint, and I am not even going to knock the rating down for this.  The pine tar bar leaves a black residue in my shower.  Assuming the tar / charcoal is what is causing this?  I won’t buy this particular one again, but the others are great!May also be good to look at buying straight off of Dr Squatches.  I looked at the price, and Amazon has posted at $2.50 higher per bar.  I didn’t get to see the shipping prices, so that may depend on how much it costs to ship buying direct.  I am a prime member, so shipping on Amazon was free.I will continue to buy this soap going forward.  The question is, will it be through Amazon or Dr Squatch?\n",
            "I used this soap to replace a prescription shampoo and have gotten really great results.  I use a different cheaper pine tar soap for my body but would love to use this one if it came in a bigger bar at a better price.  It does seem to last quite a while so I may change my mind and use just this soap as I see what kind of mileage I get with this one.\n",
            "Ever wondered what its like to be everyone's favorite libertarian? Ever wondered what feeling like the manliest man in a crowd is like? Well look no further! I got the pine tar, yes it leaves a black residue, yes it does go away faster than others, but luckily I know how to clean a tub and its worth that money. Stepping out the shower I heard quite a racket, knowing something was gonna go down, i grabbed the musket ready for a fight to find that similar to my milkshakes, this soap brought all the women to my yard. This scent leaves you feeling like you're standing there as the declaration of independence is being signed as a big screw you to England, ready to start this revolution. Makes you feel like you're Ron f_@k!n Swandon. Solid 1776/1776\n",
            "The other reviews are right about it not lasting as long as you would think, but listen, man. This soap isin't your block of chemicals that resists water like its a winter's boot. You have to take care of it so it can take care of you. I cut mine into 1/4ths and each quarter square lasts me 3 showers. You have to keep the soap DRY when not in use! Don't store in the shower!Excellent Scent. Excellent Texture. Excellent Quality. Excellent Soap.I entered the shower as a mere boy, I exited as a Man.\n",
            "My son used this once and it burned his skin!\n",
            "The smell doesn't last for more than about 30mins and I can watch the bar disintegrate as I use it each time. Not the worst product in the world, but not worth the price at all whatsoever.\n",
            "They scent smells good but it does not last long after showering.\n",
            "Soap smells great, awesome packaging and very appealing. However, it has been in our shower not under water for 5 days and it is less than half the size of when it was new. Not overused, or submerged in water, just rapidly dissolving. Would not buy again. for the price paid for one bar of soap was hoping to get more than 5-10 showers out of it.\n",
            "Not as good as the ad says it is. Yes it smells good but it doesn’t last all day. I still feel like I need to put lotion on after getting out of the shower. The ultimate chunks are nice to scratch the skin.\n",
            "I bought these for my husband. He really likes them . They smell incredible , even after a long day from work the scent is still there . Pine Tar and Gold Moss are his favorites .\n",

            "I'm on the fence with this soap. I like the scent, the exfoliating properties, the way it leaves my skin feeling and such... BUT, it only lasted four showers. Four showers for $10, for me, is a tough pill to swallow.\n",
            "It smells really nice.  That's the nicest thing that I can say about it.Hey, did you know that wood chips exfoliate your skin?  Sure.  Go rub saw dust all over your naked and wet shameful body.  You'll come out smooth.  So will you if you get the Dr Squatch soap.Do you like black soap residue all in your bath tub?  Dr. Squatch has got you covered there too.  They say it doesn't contain charcoal, but I guess that's just the pine tar.  And it's in powder form!  Yay!The good news is none of this lasts very long...  I shower once a day usually, and it lasted roughly two weeks.Go throw $10 away you fool.  Buy Dr Squatch.\n",
            "I owe this product an apology. I left a bad review a couple weeks ago after trying the black tar. I didnt care for how that smelled.But upon further using Cedar Citrus my skin cleared up & everything. Different flavors have different smells & I just couldnt do the ter soap. I have been trying to clear my skin up for years & within 2 weeks of use my black spots disappeared. This the 1 right here.\n",
            "Although I appreciate its all-natural, The pine tar was uncomfortable to shower with. The scent is ok but doesn't seem to last long. It's good soap but not for the money. I don't believe I would really purchase it again. At least the pine tar. slightly disappointed because the ads hyped it up. Maybe try a different scent.\n",
            "Awesome working soap, suds up good, leaves skin moisturized. Now the bad things are the soap smells exactly like pinesol cleaner.. If you don't use pinesol you might love the smell, and they are little pricey.. I will definitely try out the other scents because this is a very good quality soap.\n",
            "This product had excellent reviews—I just don’t see it as an excellent product. Although it’s not a terrible product, there’s nothing that’s impressive about it. I’ll be going back to my regular body wash.\n",
            "These soaps smell awesome! My girlfriend doesn’t love it but it’s better than generic soaps at other stores.Also, I’m not itchy with dried out skin like when I used generic brand soaps that were “moisturizing”.The only drawback is the price. This soap is expensive for a small amount of product.\n",

I’m sort of a clean freak so I was skeptical when people said it doesn’t last long, but I figured I’d give it a try anyways. IF and only if you keep this soap dry when you aren’t using it. It will last you (well it lasted me) around 2 1/2 weeks. That’s two showers a day mind you. BTW you don’t need the soap holder they sell. Anything that lets it dry from all sides will do. The trick is to stand out of the water when lathering on. I would’ve given five stars, but I’ll have to give four. I was under the impression that Dr. Squatch was going to clean me. Yeah that didn’t happen. Anyways I’ll recommend to anyone that asks if they should buy.\n",

            "I purchased this soap via Amazon for $10. The pine tar scent is really great and leaves me smelling fresh all day. However, the bar of soap has almost disintegrated after four uses. I don't have this issue with other main stream brands of bar soaps. I saw they have an $8 soap gripper for purchase, but as a first time buyer; I didn't want to buy more bars and a gripper. More sunk cost for a bar of soap that won't last me longer than a week.Again, great soap, but doesn't lasy very long.\n",
            "This soap is way too expensive for how long it lasts. My husband went through one bar in less than a week. Same for the second bar out of the pack. Absolutely ridiculous.\n",
            "Tiny bar of soap that is gone after 2 weeks of use.  It smells great and it works as soap (nothing over the top about it).  It's a tiny bar (biggest size they have too) and it goes away so fast.  Even with proper drying of the bar.  I'm not going to spend over 200 dollars a year (20 bucks a month) on bar soap that last 2 weeks.  Size matters.  Also how long you last matters.\n",
            "Smelled great. Unfortunately the soap completely disintegrated after three days. Thought it was a fluke with the first bar, but the remaining two bars did the same. I am an avid user of natural soaps, and I have never paid such a premium for poor quality. I bought a set for my husband and my father for Father’s Day, and they both had the same experience. Very disappointing.\n",
            "This company surely knows how to advertise and market, which probably cost's a lot of money.  The bar of soap is not worth $10, that is for sure.  Soap is OK, not great, nothing special about it.\n",
            "At first I was thrilled my package came, upon opening the box I was amazed how good it smelled. Sadly after using it for about a week my wife confirmed the scent was not lasting at all. I used it on my face and hair many times and seemed pretty rough. Sorry won't be using this soap again\n",
            "Nice sent. Good (not great) lather. NOT FOR SENSITIVE SKIN!You could use this soap for sandpaper. In fact it’s probably compares to a 40 grit sandpaper. If you like that sort of scrub, you are good. Otherwise stay away!!!!\n"

It really feels like I’m giving my skin a good scrub without irritating my sensitive skin. It’s also not too slippery and easy to use.One of the reasons I don’t normally use bar soap is because whenever I’m not using it in the shower (such as when I’m washing my hair) the bar will start melting and the soap will start disintegrating. This makes the bar not last very long. HOWEVER, it seems to me that the Squatch bar is good at retaining its form when I’m not using it. It’s the little things that make me happy.\n",

            "I just received this product 3 days ago.The soap itself is great. Skin feels very clean & the soap smells great. I was actually surprised to find how hydrated and fresh it made my skin feel.I’ll most likely buy this product again, my only complaint is that the bars are pretty small.Again, I’ve only had it for 3 days and I’m already done with a bar.. that’s disappointing but otherwise it’s good soap\n",

This stuff smells really good, it makes my skin feel great and I personally will be buying this soap again. My wife enjoys the smell of it too. It also doesn't leave any gross or slippery mess on the bottom of the shower when I am finished.\n",

The square corners and black reidue all over the shower are also negatives.  It looks the soap was made in a brownie bad and cut into squares in someone's garage.  I will not buy the soap again.\n",

I bought another bar for myself to see if it would help ward off dry, itchy skin in the winter.  I have used it several times and love its exfoliating properties.  I have high hopes for this product.\n",

            "In my epic quest to find a soap that doesnt detroy my skin ive come across this one, i mean they have a bunch of youtube ads how could i not hear of this one?  With their claims of all natural ingrediants i was eager. I ordered this one to be my first.  I have about 2 complaints about this soap. The first is i seem to only be able to get about 4 washes with it.  2nd and perhaps the most important, after the second wash it dried my hands out so much that my hands started cracking and peeling which is NOT what i want from a soap.  If it works for others cool it doesnt work for me wont be getting it again\n",
            "Unless you want to smell like your kitchen floor I recommend not buying this. Also this company will send you 5 to 10 emails every single day and they won’t take you off their list until you jump through some hoops first. Don’t do it. Just make your own damn soap if you want handmade soap. You could probably make 10 times as much for the price. And if you make it yourself you don’t have to put sand in it which is just bizarre. But the worst thing is these people will send you 5 to 10 emails every single damn day like you need that much damn soap.\n",
            "This soap is terrific, but be warned. These soaps are quite expensive, and each 5oz bar will only last for 10-15 showers tops. They are of premium quality, but unless you can consistently afford premium price, stay away. When you go back to regular body wash, it's quite depressing.\n",

It is now 1/1/2021 and the soap is a sliver - nearly gone. I read the reviews, and it indicated that it would last a month. My husband showers once a day. He's bald, and only uses it as a body wash. I was just disappointed that this lasted less than half of the amount of time it was advertised.\n",

I'd give my total review a 5-star rating, but the price of these soaps is more than anyone should pay for soap.  I wanted to give them a try, so I did.  However, the likelihood of me being a repeat buyer is slim.  If the prices go down...........\n",

Dr. Squatch soap is the real deal. Dr. Squatch works exactly as advertised, wash with this soap in the morning and you will feel it on your skin all day long.There are only 2 things that I was dissatisfied with about this soap is, first  the scent does not last long 1-2 hours out if the shower and I couldn't smell it anymore, and second is the size of the bar I bought 2 bars and each bar lasted just about 1 week and for the price I was very disappointed\n",

            "This is a great bar soap.Somehow at the end of the day there's some type of dryness in the groin area and noble parts specifically the testicles that produces a rash that you have to scratched it with porpuse. Other than that it is a good bar soap. (sorry for being so graphic)\n",

I don't see a problem with how long I stay in the shower because I have use other soaps that actually last. 10$ too much for soap that don't last at all. So Disappointing\n",

I just fixed my lawnmower, then my heater. All I do these days is fix things, spend time outdoors, exercise an hour a day, and get hit on by beautiful women. Also as a bonus, something else grew 3 sizes just like the Grinches heart. I would recommend this to anyone who wants get in touch with all their testosterone and masculinity.\n",

            "BF wanted to switch from shower gel to try to feel more \"exfoliated\", so I got him this. It takes a couple showers to get to the exfoliating beads in each bar, and then the soap withers to nothing so fast. Each bar only lasted about 10 showers (he is a big guy but c'mon).They do leave his skin soft and smelling good though.\n",
            "The scent is like slicing through 100+ year old barnwood or being on the set of one of those trendy HGTV barnwood builders shows. The feel?? Pretty sure I just scrubbed ALL the dead skins off with the incorporated exfoliating sawdust...man heaven! Just like the REAL “squatch” (he exists), this soap made a brief appearance in my shower before it disappeared. It’s footprint, black sludge on my shower floor! All in all great product, just wished it lasted longer as my wife likes to say!\n",
            "Honestly, this is hands down the best soap I have ever used. It started out with my boyfriend giving it a try and he is absolutely hooked on their products. All of their soaps, even the shampoo/conditioner they have. Even though they advertise it for men, it’s great for a woman’s skin too. I have used other natural made soaps for women and they dry out my skin and cause for breakouts to happen. Ever since I have been using the Dr Squatch soap, it has moisturized my skin and has made a huge difference in my complexion over night. To wrap it up, even though it’s advertised towards men, ladies give it a try cause it’s the best soap you’ll ever use.\n",

Im sure the other scents are better. Also the soap is very soft and only lasts about 2 to 3 weeks and that is way to short for 10 bucks a bar\n",
            "I really like this soap because it leaves my skin feeling good. The scent is nice but doesn’t last particularly long. The hard flakes of oatmeal feel great and really exfoliate the skin. Since the bar is made in a more natural process it doesn’t last as long as a normal buy, but you’re paying for the quality and it doesn’t leave anything to be desired.\n",
            "Smells amazing. Skin feels great. At this price, bar should definitely last longer than it did. 5-10 uses is all you'll get before it's just a sliver of time to buy more expensive soap.\n",
            "Stuff is good, yeah it doesn't last 3 months like a bar of dove, but dont leave it in a puddle. Put it in a spot where itll dry and use a  loofah.. doesn't need to be some hippy vegan sea sponge.. just a scrubbing poof ball chingadera and itll last a while. Think I'm going on 3 weeks with one bar now.. I still have a gf so I cant stink too bad. Shower once or twice a day depending.\n",
            "I really like the way the soap feels and smells. I started using this soap a month ago and I have to tell you I cannot get enough of pine tar. I have tried some of the other scents that squatch dr has and by far pine tar is their best seller. I have also purchased one of their colognes which I think is also pine scented and it is amazing how much scent you get when you put just a dab on your body and rub it in. I would and have recommended this product to some of my friends and I encourage you guys to do the same!  You won't be disappointed.\n",

Try lowering it down to at least $5.50- $6 and I just may buy it again . Other than that I'll just go to one of the local stores and buy and similar and just as good of a product from a different company\n",
            "This soap stinks. Don’t be like me - a sucker for good marketing. This soap is awful. I bought the 3 pack to try different scents, they all smell like a slightly varied version of cardboard. So disappointing! Definitely not moisturizing or sensitive skin.\n",
            "Cleans extremely well, compared to other soaps I've tried. Scent is divine and very natural, however didn't stick very well to my skin. Didn't last very long either so do use sparingly (I only use these on days where my work had been extremely demanding and I needed a good  rub)Probably will buy them again when I get bored of the artificial smell of other soaps.\n",
            "I originally bought a 3-pack for my guy because I thought the Dr. Squatch advertisements were hilarious. Well, turns out, the ads were accurate, and he can talk at length about how great his new soap is. This has led me to purchase the 10-pack. He works on an oil-rig and gets caked in mud and brine on the daily. He feels fresh and actually clean using this soap (and smells good too)!\n",
            "Wow. It would fill the bathroom with an amazing scent. I loved shower time. It would clean me thoroughly. Easy on the skinDownfall: it wore down to nothing very fast. Also left black soap stains all over my shower. Pain to clean off. Also once outside of the shower I couldn’t smell the scent on me anymore.\n",
            "Pros, it smells pretty. A little bit goes a long way.Cons: It's 10 bucks a bar...crazy price.  It's too big, my stubby fingers can barely maintain their grip\n",
            "This soap smells ok. Nothing spectacular or as strong as I was expecting. I did like the exfoliation. You can really feel it scrubbing your skin. It works great. My only complaint is that it doesn't last very long. I was very surprised how much of the bar was used just after one use. For the price I would expect this to last a bit longer. I probably won't be purchasing again.\n",
            "I was fooled by the advertising for this soap being all natural and good for the skin this product is so abrasive to the skin hardly has any scent and probably is one of the worst soaps I’ve ever used shame on the company for using false advertising I would never buy this product nor would I recommend it to anyone\n",
            "My grandson loves this stuff and refuses to use anything else ever again. Don’t dry your skin and smells nice. He says I’m a man (12) and I’m using natural good things now that are not harming me or the planet.\n",
            "The commercial made me curious so I said screw it, I’ve spent $10 on less worthy ventures. I bought the Pine Tar and I have to say I am enamored by this Fancy Soap. I’ll keep buying it because it makes muh’body feel good. You might like it too. Won’t know unless you try it out.\n"

            "Love the scents on all of the soaps, suds up great as well. Only two complaints about this soap for me is the size which i think is on the small size and that it doesn't last very long. I've lost about half of the bar from two weeks of use and it almost melts from the steam. If im not gentle with it it would probably squish in my hand. Max I'd say it's about 4 weeks/bar of use. Only other bar I can compare to by recent use is dove which i used to get about 8-10 weeks of use\n",
            "Really like the scent of the bar, however I didn't find that scent to last. After using it just smelled soapy on my skin. I do however like the way it leaves your skin feeling. Not oily, very clean feeling.\n",
            "Don’t waste your money. Started using this bar Sunday and it’s now Friday and the bar is almost gone. For $10 it should last much longer. Disappointing. Also, the sand or oatmeal is so sharp it scratches your skin instead of exfoliating.\n",
            "Got this for my husband as a stocking stuffer, it has a odd smell, not bad, but not good. It also doesn’t last long, 1 1/2 weeks and that’s being generous! Wont buy again!\n",
            "Great soap and smell, but very bad for the pocket. This soap wont last a week if you shower twice a day and, litteralry, it is treating the soaps as efficient as possible. If you do as the ad said (soaping your chest to the get white foam) it will not last even a day or two!Nice soap, nice smell and results, but overpriced by multiple times!\n",
            "I bought a bar to support the company because I love the commercials. I was surprised to see how good it actually was. Great lather and moisturizing. easily the best bar soap I've ever used. I really did step out of the shower feeling ALIVE!😂. With that said it's way out of my price range with a one income home to continue using which is depressing😭.\n",
            "I wasn’t too satisfied with this bar of soap. The YouTube & Instagram commercials really hype up this product but the scent doesn’t last that long. I got out of the shower and I can barley smell it on my skin. Sorry to promote another product but the Harry’s bar of soap from Target smells a lot better and last a lot longer. Thank you,\n",
            "I've had them for about a week and the pine tar is probably my favorite one. Like I said they fade quickly. I've only used the pine tar a few times and it seem like it's lost half of it's mass in those few times. However my skin does feel better and I love the scents. I use it as a shaving soap as well it does great as a shaving soap!\n",
            "The smell and initial texture are excellent, but then, in just a few days, I can see that it is not going to last $10 worth of time. I've been working hard to ensure it rests in a dry place between showers, but it's like it soaks up water during use and then leaches that water all day making it so soft that the original texture is lost. I really wanted to love it for the advertised reasons, which are true, but this rapid disintegration is severe in my experience.\n",

The bar of soap is super rich and produces a nice thick lather along with what has to be the best soap I’ve ever smelt. Just a side note, you WILL want a soap dish due to the soap bar being very runny after it’s wet (understandably so). I will be buying more from them in the future! Thank you Mr.Squatch !\n",

            "Great soap - my daughter wanted to use it for her sensitive skin.  Works well and great quality.  Highly recommend.  Smells clean and good lather.  Just beware that sometimes it leaves black marks in the shower, but they clean up easily.\n",
            "Lovely smell, amazing bar of soap. Leaves skin feeling soft and smooth. Only thing is that the smell doesn't last too long. Would recommend getting the Dr. Squatch pine tar cologne to make the scent stronger and last longer. Some of the bars after a while of use will break apart (especially the older ones), so I would recommend ordering from their website unless you just like the fast shipping that comes with prime and will take that chance (Which I do.)\n",

            "Is a pretty good soap, a little bit difficult to handle when you are showering, and rubbing around my body. Maybe should think to change the shape to oval, easy to handle.\n",
            "Soap was just boring and utilitarian until I ordered my first sampler pack of Dr. Squatch. My favorite is Pine Tar, but I keep Gold Moss, Bay Rum and Cedar Citrus in rotation. I keep them out of the shower spray and let them dry between uses and I am still on my first batch. They may be a little pricey, but it's just so much more invigorating than the Dove for Men I was using, and keeps lather on the cloth all the way to my toes.\n",

            "OMG!  Pine Tar - OUCH!  I felt like I was rubbing sandpaper on me.  It actually felt like I had little scratches throughout my body once I was done.\n",

I feel my skin doesn't get NEARLY as dry as with body washes(I've used lots of different brands), I also feel like I don't get B.O. nearly as fast. I will be buying more once this first set runs out.\n",
            "They do smell good! The pine tar is my favorite but it does scratch your skin if you don’t use a cloth to wash with and only use the bar to wash.  The pine tar stains the bathtub wherever you store it. the Color runs down the tub and stains it. Each bar doesn’t last long so buy a few of them! They last maybe a week or so. They do the job! Nothing special but decent enough. I would buy them if they sold them in the stores only if they were a little cheaper then the expensive bars of soap.\n",
            "The best soap ever! I could never find a soap that wouldn’t make my hands itch like crazy for hours after showering and dry my skin. Showers used to suck, now I look forward to them! Thanks dr squatch!\n",
            "This is a tough review. Honestly, the product itself is great. The soap smells great, and it lasts all day. The only issue is the soap itself doesn’t last long. I showered twice and I don’t see how the soap is going to last until next week. Also, the price is ridiculous. I really wanted to try this, and I am glad I did, but unless they adjust the price or figure out a way to make it last longer then this will be my last purchase.\n",
            "LOVE THEM! I will buy again!  Smell amazing, leave skin clean, and are 100 times better than bodywash. A little more pricey, but willing to pay for them without complaining.\n",
            "These are overrated soap but sold with great marketing. Don't fall for it. They're cold pressed which runs out faster. One bar doesn't even last me 2 full weeks and that's being conservative. I know some that use it up 4 days. The smell is overrated but the good thing is that it's organic and PH balanced. My favorite is the deep sea goats milk and I've tried almost all of their soap. It's expensive, runs out fast, and isn't worth it. Unless you don't mind going through multiple bars every once in a while.\n",
            "I can’t give it a five star review because it just doesn’t last that long for the price. After use I remove it from the shower and keep it dry but it still only last about a week and a half for me. It would be worth it if they weren’t so expensive\n",
            "I’m going to start off my addressing the shape. The first couple showers your going to be stabbing yourself with the hard corners from this SQUARE soap and only after a few washes will they smooth out. Next is the smell which I felt was generic and short lasting considering the hype it gets based on “real reactions”. Lastly after a week of showering it’s almost gone. Just like that. Marlowe is where to go for a quality soap.\n",
            "Although I like this soap, it only lasted about half the time a normal bar of soap would. At $10/bar, that can be substantial over the course of the year.\n",
            "I have had a hard time finding a soap I like. I have slightly sensitive skin and have been using body wash for years because soap just makes me feel all dried out. I got the Pine Tar to test it out because I was intrigued by the ingredients. After using it, my skin felt a little dry but what I noticed is that about ten minutes later after I had dried off I was left with a soft smooth feeling that didn’t feel dry at all. I also like the woody scent and am looking forward to using this for a long time and trying other soaps from this brand.\n"

After the first shower with the soap, it did not seem like the same scent that the original bar had. Once I walked around with it, my wife had asked what the mold smell was. Horrified, I approached her, and she politely smiled and suggested that the scent might calm down in a bit. After she pointed out that it smelled like mold, I cannot un-smell it. I have only used it one time. I try to smell the bar now and then hoping that it has changed, but it has not at all.\n",
            "The soap is very water soluble, so you can use it up quickly if you don't use something like a lufa, sponge or washcloth. It has to stay as dry as possible.  I can say it is very, very gentle on the skin but the ads I've seen promote the scent, which is why I bought the soap; thinking it would keep my stinky, sasquatch-ass  smelling like daisies! But no, like every other soap the aroma fades the moment you step out of the shower.  Final word: very gentle on the skin but not very good for sasquatches.\n",
            "I like the way it smells, seems to clean pretty good, however it seems to wear down quickly for the price, I guess it's better than cleaning with a bunch of chemicals.\n",
            "I like the smell and overall feel, but the oatmeal can also be rough, more than exfoliating. The first two times using the bar left scratches on my skin. Nothing broke skin, just red lines everywhere from the oatmeal being dry.\n",
            "This is not a bad product if you like this pack contains as advertised it a very very good pack that can last you maybe 4 months worth of soap that you can use if you have rashes.\n",
            "as a person that comes from a family that always cooked oil passed soap bars i must say this product is great but on down fall; for some reason it does not last long enough. so is it worth the $10 most definetly not. for $5.00 yes its great.\n",
            "This is a very good soap, I would use it daily if I could afford it, but it's 10 bucks and lasts a little bit more than a week, not worth it.won't be buying this again. (unless the price drops ridicously)\n",
            "I was pretty excited to get this in the mail, which I find a bit odd since it's soap. I do love the smell of pine tar though. I've become a bit addicted to Grand Pa's piine tar soap but wanted to try out some others. Well Dr. Squatch's Pine Tire doesn't smell like Pine Tar, or Pine, or the Woods, it smells like perfume or something foofy. I took a whiff, plopped it back in the box and got my money back. If you are looking for a woodsy smelling soap this isn't it.\n",
            "Purchased for husband & he loves! He has sensitive skin & has had no irritations whatsoever. He loves the smell & says it is invigorating! Skin feels fresh & moisturized! He has also recommended to his friends & family because he loves it so much!\n",
            "Dr Squatch is the best soap I've ever used! LOVE the aroma of Pine Tar, Bay Rum, and the IPA. The pine tar's lather is crisp, manly and ultimately refreshing.

            "Not what I expected, just smells like any ordinary soap, only because they say it has natural ingredients, they said the smell would be like a sailor or the sea but it has little to no smell, disappointed. Fake advertisement, for at least this one. Nautical sage was supposed to be the best one that smells amazing but, very disappointed, smells plain and dull 1$ soap 😡\n",
            "The marketing of this soap is so good I had to try it. I have nothing negative to say about the soap other than it's far too overpriced. I would be a long-term customer if the soap were similarly priced to other soaps on the market.\n",
            "My wife had to air out the house after I showered with this soap! She thought I spilled cleaner. My son said what's that smell?.. it smells like bad farts... worst soap ever. I bought it because I thought it would make me less itchy, witch it did, but it certainly left me irritated.\n",
            "This bar has the strongest scent among the other soaps but it doesn't last long once you exit the shower with the soap. Great scent if it would last longer.\n",
            "1. Pine Tar, smells like pinsol cleaner and literally has sand in it. Also it will leave black residue all over your shower. 2. Cedar Citrus, Smells like a citronella candle not pleasant. 3. Gold Moss, this was my favorite and it smells like the woods in the fall. Fresh and clean smelling. The bars are too small for what they cost.\n",
            "I bought this for my 18-year-old son who had requested it. He loves the commercials! And for that matter, now that he showed them to me, I love them too! This is a very fun marketing campaign. And it seems to be a quality, all natural soap. And he definitely loves the concept of an all natural soap, as he was looking for something healthier for his skin. He loves the scent. He has only used it once, but is very happy with the quality as well. I am sure there are equally good products priced at a much lower cost. For us, this is a bit of a novelty. This seems more like an occasional gift, then every day use item.\n",
            "Disappointed. Disappears quickly, smells pretty bad, like toilet cleaner. I’ve had way better natural soaps at half the cost and twice the value.\n",
            "My boyfriend and I LOVE this soap. We’ve even noticed that different bars have different benefits. For the example the Pine Tar is good for exfoliating and the Cedar Citras is more moisturizing. The only downside is that between the two of us, they bars don’t last very long.\n",
            "I wanna start off by saying i immediately got made fun of for the purchase/smell by my fiance. And not sure if the squach himself had pancakes the morning of packing/shipping my order or if it was my local postal setvice but there was what i hope n believe to be maple syrup all over the package either that or he was a little to happy that day on how much money he is banking on this latest and weird natural soap crave.\n",
            "Not the best, but I like it's unique smell, but damned if they are not trying to get splinters in you. I don't mind because I careful use my hands and then spread it. I do not scrub with the bar.My favorite is cedar, but this is a nice change.\n",

This soap - Dr. Squatch Bay Rum Soap - brings back the memories and Wonderful Aroma of Bay Rum.  I have bought this for my father - he uses it every time that he showers, and he washes his hair with the Dr. Squatch Bay Rum Soap also.  Aroma lasts.  I would recommend this to any man - especially if he likes women sniffing him.\n",
            "Smells great but I haven't used it yet. Extremely disappointed, when I select the count it shows a picture of 5 bars and labeled for 5 bars as \"1 count\". When looking at the Pine Tar scent the option also shows a labeled 5 bar set. When both descriptions show a 5 bar count.....it's extremely misleading. Will update my review based on customer support and how it effects my skin.\n",
            "Soap was , well soap! Was basically just like Irish Spring just $9 more. Nothing wrong with the product just really wouldn’t recommend paying this amount for soap that does what a $1 bar can do.\n",
            "Smelled great, liked the consistency - but the bar only lasted for maybe 8 showers.  Pretty spendy to replace that often.  Otherwise, it is as described.\n",
            "Got this for my boyfriend to try and he tried it and said he has never felt so clean. He's a mechanic and always has old stains and stuff on his arms and hands and it was gone. He even looked cleaner. He feels and smells so good. Im actually jealous he was so soft and clean. Amazing. Definitely be buying more and trying out their other products.\n",
            "clean smell, good lather, feel clean after, no residue, soft smell, noticed by those close to you but not in same room with you, no soap scum build up noticed\n",
            "Big square at first so it’s hard to manage, smells good and doesn’t bother my skin, doesn’t last as long as regular soap but it’s different and probably better because it’s natural\n",
            "This Pine Tar is my fav so far can’t wait to try the rest!Believe me this soap is worth your money in my experience! Has a slight rough scrub to it so if you have sensitive to touch or weak skin lol don’t buy this one\n",
            "This is the best soap that I’ve ever used on my body. It smells pretty good, holds its scent, and definitely gives me a confidence booster knowing I smell good. It makes my skin soft, and genuinely moisturizes my body. My only issue with it is that it doesn’t last as long as other soaps, with one bar it lasted me approximately 2 weeks. For the price, I’d say it’s a pretty good deal. I will be buying this product, and other scents, again.\n",
            "Love the scent of the pine tar, I have two others left to use. Bar does go fast like stated in other reviews, I’ll be on bar 2 in about a week( week and a half of use) so for the price it would be nice to see twice the bar or half the cost. Other than price for what you get and how long it last, I’m very satisfied so far.Side note: you should look into creating candles in your popular scents. I’d definitely purchase.\n"

That’s 7-10 showers. And at that rate I’ll stick with something else. If they could find a way to make it last as long as a big name brand, I’d be a lifelong customer, but until then I’ll remain zestfully clean\n",
            "This will be the best soap you ever buy.  Don’t matter what the videos say about how it makes you smell good and all that. I promise you, the level of softness that your skin will achieve with this bar is unreal. I’m talking baby’s rear with baby powder lol. I bought a second one days later for my pops cause I couldn’t believe it. He used it, had me order him another lol. We will be keeping this sucker in stock for sure.\n",

            "I've always used some form of Old Navy liquid soaps, which are fine and smell great, but I've always had very dry skin after showering - typically on my face and arms. After using Dr. Squatch for only 3 days I can really tell a difference. The scent is strong but not overbearing and my skin not only feels clean but completely moisturized afterward. I've yet to need to apply lotion after showering. I definitely recommend this to anyone with dry skin,  your body will thank you.\n",
            "Great smelling soap with tough exfoliating texture. The only downside is that the soap did not last very long. It dissolved pretty quickly.\n",
            "This is great stuff. I got the pine tar. I love the scent and the exfoliating grain and texture. Don't expect this to last too long though. If I could change one thing I would either reduce the price pint or increase longevity. This was my first shot at this soap. Probably wont get again only due to price point. Hey Dr. Squatch!! Make some long lasting cost effective stuff! Maybe something mentholated to wash all these COVID vibes away!\n",
            "Wanted to use two bars before I wrote this. Once the scent disapaites or the outer layer it feels worse than dial bar.Not very moisturizing on top of that had no scent.Once this pack is used up not going to ever get these....not worth the $$$\n",
            "My husband said this soap smells great and has little exfoliators in it so it feels nice. He isn’t sure how long it will last as he just started using it at Christmas a couple weeks ago. He would recommend it to others. He says it’s a “manly soap”.\n",
            "Very nice scent but pricey for a bar of soap and the bar dissolves quickly so even though I like the scent I wouldn’t purchase again at that price\n",
            "Smells good but didn’t last long , I bought as a gift for my husband, maybe he just uses soap fast but now eat I could afford to buy regularly\n",
            "This soap is definitely rugged and exfoliates well. It has the perfect scent strength IMO in that it's barely noticeable after the shower, but it sticks around for a long time. Perfect for men who want to smell good when someone is close to them without wafting the smell 10 feet away. I also LOVE that they don't use plastic microbeads for abrasion as these have been wreaking havoc on our Great Lakes here in Michigan. Overall an excellent product, I would recommend to any man (or woman if it tickles your fancy).\n",
            "Really enjoying the soap and glad I moved to a more natural soap vs the Dove or whatever.Only issue, and its not insignificant, is that the bars do not last.That is to say they go really quick, 1 bar lasted me 4 days.I really enjoy the soap and for now I will continue to use but I don't think it will be sustainable long-term if sub-1 week is the normal lifespan of a bar.\n",

            "Honest review.When I saw the commercial I was excited about this product, finally a product men for men.After receiving the product i was disappointed first with the quality and second with the scent.The bar of soap lated me 5 days have in mind that I showered 2 times a day so 10 showers total.The scent was ok but didn't last long, my skin did not felt soft at all and my hair felt dry.The price that I paid for this product it's a total rip off 9 dollars for a soap that last 5 days no thank youWill not buy again\n",
            "So I am writing this review roughly a week after using the Pine Tar scent each day. I have sensitive skin and I break out a lot, probably because of sweating from work and working out and this product hasn’t seemed to help that but I honestly didn’t expect it to. The smell is great, doesn’t leave my skin dry and flaky like most other bar soaps so that’s definitely awesome. Although for the price it’s meh, doesn’t last as long as I’d like but it is pretty cool.\n",
            "Been issuing for a while now. They all smell great and have helped my acne.  They do melt quickly so be sure to leave in a dry place. I would recommend.\n",
            "It would be nice if the scent would actually transfer to your skin and it would be nice for the cost,if the bar of soap lasted more than a week, It just melted away and reminded me of dove bar soap.\n",
            "The pine tar soap was spectacular while it lasted. Smelled wonderful, moisturized and exfoilated well. However, at 3 showers a day (before starting the day, after mid-day gym, and getting home at night) the soap lasted me barely a week. It makes it hard for me to reconcile the price point for something I'm going to burn through immediately. Therefore, I feel compelled to leave only 3 stars for this product, as much as it hurts me to do so. It's hard to find a soap that wont leave your skin stressed and dry after that much washing, but this one left me feeling great. Make it last longer, or drop the price, and I would eagerly change to 5 stars and be a lifelong customer.\n",
            "Love the scents; makes my entire bathroom smell good with the bars just sitting around in their boxes.Lathers up nicely and makes my dry, Wisconsin winter skin feel pretty good. That is not an easy task.It would also appear as though the bars will last a while.\n",
            "Everyone has to change the soap they are using, by trying this soap I found out just like what the advertisement said, my old soap isn't doing what is should. Let me give an example, using my old soap which is a top brand and I have been using for 30 years, when it came to washing my arm pits, I would have to soap up 5 or more times to get the cleanliness I am looking for. With this soap 1 time and underarm oder gone. My skin feels so much better, less itching less dryness after a shower. I am so happy I watched that YouTube video. Dare I say it (changed my life). It's a bar of soap I know it but I am a believer.\n",
            "Nothing special to speak of at all for 10 bucks for 1 bar!!!?? Weird smell and texture!! But what a push of this mediocre to bad product\n",
            "Let me start by saying I love this soap! The smell is great and true to its name. It has a great woodsy aroma that isn't overpowering.  The soap itself has sand in it for exfoliation which is an added benefit. The soap suds up very well and leaves your skin feeling clean. Afterwards you don't feel as if your skin is dry, but hydrated and clean. The only thing I wish was better about the bar was the lifespan of it. The bar does seem to dwindle, but may be just as fast as any other bar of the same size. I hope in the future they make the bars larger, so it has a little more use time. I highly recommend this product and will be a lifetime customer. Already have the Bay Rum scent as a replacement to this bar. Great soap!\n",
            "Overall, I liked the Pine Tar well enough and could certainly tell a difference in how clean I felt after using it. I think I'd have been happier with one of the others. I've been primarily using bottled body washes for decades and am old enough to remember when they weren't as common. When I was a kid, everyone in the family basically used a communal bar of soap that touched every crack, rack, and sack in the house at least once a day. It was something that nobody talked about though it was certainly on our minds every time we reached for that bar. That bar always seemed to last forever. Most likely because of all the whatever the hell it is they put in them. I will be trying one of the others soon, and keep it out of the running water in the shower so it doesn't turn into nice-smelling goo that washes down the drain within a week of buying it.\n"

The bar lasted 1 week for me, even when stored on a dry tray outside of the shower.Also, the exfoliants are also very rough when you first use the bar, but by the second or third use, it gets much better.The scent is great and everything, but again, it's tough to justify it at the cost.\n",

Dr Squatch has done a great job building their image but Honest Amish makes better soap and has a great offering of other products including beard oils, balms, etc...\n",
            "Absolutely love the soap.  Shower gels weren't working for me so I looked to getting a new soap.  I found your product on line, loved the commercial and bought the soap.  They all perform as advertised and then some.  I feel much better after my shower and my wife loves the scent on me.  That alone is worth the price of the soap.\n",

I live in the country in Mississippi so my back yard is full of oak, pine, cedar, and a few pecan trees. After a heavy rain,  the pines and cedars smell wonderful. After the first use if this bar of soap, my house had that same smell and my fiance loved it. Not to mention she loved how I smelled. If you want to smell like a man, get this soap.\n",

            "I saw some of the reviews on here claiming the soap didn't last very long. I decided to do my own test. I got 21 uses out of this bar, so about 3 weeks. It does leave a slight black residue like some claimed, but it is harmless and easily wiped away. The smell is amazing, especially if you love pine tar like I do. It lathers well, but in my humble opinion it's not worth $9.45 since you'll only get 3 weeks use out of it. And if you're wondering, yes, I use a soap saver to prevent unnecessary melting.\n",
            "I work in law-enforcement. After wearing all the equipment we have all day long it feels great to exfoliate my skin with Dr. Squatch. I come out feeling clean, the Sent is remarkable. And my skin feels great afterwards. If I had to choose a bad thing it would be that the bar just wasn’t big enough to last longer.\n",
            "I really thought this was going to be a good bar of a soap. The soap has large chunks of junk in it, so when you scrub your scratch yourself. Long story short, this soap sucks ass\n",
            "This soap is great, the only soap that i have ever used that doesn't cause me to have itchy skin afterwards. It leaves my skin soft and hydrated for the whole day. In addition the sand and oats in there feels amazing. Unfortunately, I personally don't think the aroma is what it's hyped up to be, it is okay at best. And it is already gone after using it 10 times. It's a good bar of soap, but the price is a too steep.\n",
            "It was a present for my fiancé. He LOVES the scent of it, and the exfoliating feel to it.Also edited- he broke out after use, but turns out he’s allergic to pine, so I don’t recommend this if you are allergic to pine 😂. It’s well made soap and he didn’t break out for any other reason other than he’s just allergic to pine!\n",
            "Way too expensive! I can’t afford a $30.00 month soap habit, lol. Soap does not last very long and I thought it smelled like pine sol cleaner. Great marketing though.\n",
            "I love it smells absolutely amazing. I love the abrasive feel of the soap just like it's discribed. I will definitely be using this brand from now on.  Helped clear up my skin in just a 3 or 4 days. I would recommend a different scent if you have sensitive skin though since this one is made to be abrasive.\n",
            "really really love this but its super expensive and it only lasted like 3 days..  granted the husband showers twice a day even so it would only last one week.. and that's with just one person using it..\n",
            "Yeah so this product is really great. After I got  done showering the soap I used previously didn’t feel a great as this soap. It’s great on oily skin and for once I don’t smell as bad. I normally work hard and smell like a skunk.\n",

My neck had serious bumps, but after applying this directly to my neck/face on a daily basis I'm feeling a lot better.It's been well over s month since purchase. I know a lot of folks complain the soap goes well, but for my purpose, it lasts plenty long.\n",

            "While definitely a unique smell for soap, the Pine Tar Squatch Soap is by far my favorite so far. It applies thick but lathers quick, and definitely leaves you feeling fresh. Don't use a loofah with it! This soap is best applied and disengaged by hand, allowing the soap smell to linger on your skin for much longer. I recommend using this soap in conjunction with Tom's of Maine North Woods deodorant. The smells compliment each other very, very well, and really exacerbates the Woodsy smell aesthetic.I highly recommend this product and will continue to purchase it in the future!\n",

            "For just me using it it lasted 2 months now. Almost out so just ordered more but probably have 2 more weeks to go.Out feels great on your skin and smells great. Would recommend others buying it as well. Just ordered another scent to try it out.\n",
            "Smells good but seems like you can’t smell it on ya after using it. Maybe someone snuggling up with you can smell it but it’s not as strong of smell on ya after a shower as they act on advertising. Only smells strong when you put it to your nose smelling it.\n",
            "Smells great but scent and soap bar don’t last very long. Leaves a good clean feel and really makes your shower smell good, but the scent doesn’t last long on your skin. The bar of soap doesn’t last all that long. I got just over two weeks with the soap.\n",
            "I did alot research reading reviews and talking to my friends about Dr Squatch natural soap before purchasing. After using this soap for a week, I was not at all impressed, even a little bit. Pine tar was the scent I chose to try first. I couldn't tell I was using soap. The smell was very faint in my opinion. Long story short, I will continue to use my \"chemical gargabe\" (aka) my old body wash, rather then purchase Dr Squatch soap again.\n",
            "First off, the advertising for the product is some of the best I’ve seen. I’m sure many people felt the same way and bought the product. I have to say, it is an incredible soap. Might even say some of the best I’ve ever used. But the price leaves something to be desired for the size. 5 ounce is simply not enough for the price.  The soap goes very quickly. My biggest advice of the company would be to produce an 8 to 10 ounce bar.\n",
            "I didn’t notice any difference between this soap and other brand’s soap. And one thing I didn’t liked about this soap is that it’s SMELL. It doesn’t smell pleasant, it smells like rust or something. On the advertisement it said it smells GOOD and girls will like it. But it’s happens to be not trues.\n",
            "I’m a 27 year old man and am a huge fan of all natural skin care products. This usually means spending a lot of money for designer products. These work great, don’t get me wrong, but this soap will replace all of them. My skin has never felt so refreshed and tight after a shower. I can’t wait to watch this brand grow and start using more of their products in the future.\n",
            "*Made me bleed*Smells just like PinesolIf you've got sensitive skin you should know this soap has jagged exfoliating rocks or walnut shells in it. It exfoliating blood out of me which seems like something that shouldn't be an issue with soap.The pine smell is stronger than anticipated. You'll smell like an accomplished janitor.I do like their other soaps like the eucalyptus one. Just this one was disappointing.\n",
            "Really good soap. However, it doesn’t last long at all especially for price paid. If money is no object then buy this soap and use it daily. If money is an issue maybe but it once and use sparingly place in box after every use and store it outside of bathroom. It will last much longer and go easy on the wallet ;)\n",

Didn't have gloves so my hands, legs, and somehow my face was covered in sap and dirt. Hopped it the shower and the soap went to work. Took off all the sap, dirt, sweat, and even some bugs.

Looks like the soap hunting is over.Outstanding product.\n",
            "Item is displayed and within the description for the Pine tar soap.  I was very excited to get this package, but yet no pine tar soap.  That was really the only one that I wanted.  So overall, false advertisement at its best.\n",
            "If you’ve not seen their ads on YouTube, you’re missing out. They’re epic!Aside from incredibly good marketing, these soaps are extremely high quality. Not the cheapest stuff out there, but sometimes you have to pay to play.My personal fav is a toss-up between Pine Tar and the Aloe Citrus, or whatever they call it.Seriously, you should try it..., and go see their ads!\n",
            "My teenage son loves the Dr. Squatch Pine Tar Soap. It smells wonderful and is great for sensitive skin. It is a little on the pricey side so I do suggest storing it in an enclosed soap dish to preserve it.\n",
            "Nautical Sage soap from Dr. Squatch is one of three scents I chose in my initial 10 bar order.  I sometimes make soap for friends and family for gifts so I have a very particular idea of what makes a great bar of soap, and Dr. Squatch fits the bill and will probably be making it my go-to soap from now on!  The scents are amazing - Pine Tar has been my favorite so far - it lathers up nicely, amd leaves me feeling clean and happy.  Buying from Dr. Squatch is a full customer experience - buy some just to get the shipment notification from the shipping department!  The ingredients are what you would expect from a good, natural soap.  The price is on the high end of what I am willing to pay for a bar of soap, but given the bar size, the packaging, the performance, and the quality discount, I still consider it a good value.  Keep it Squatchy my friends!\n",
            "As can be seen in the picture I routinely work up a sweat and Dr. Squatch pine tar soap is the perfect human cleaner (I've met several Sasquatchs that could benefit by it as well).  Also, I'm done with liquid bath soap goop with micro plastic beads and such which I'm told is bad for the Sasquatch environment. Finally, assuming Dr. Squatch is genetically related to our hairy friends, I feel good about supporting the genome.  Call it trans-dimensional charity if you must but I end up with the soap.\n",
            "After seeing the ad’s on YouTube I thought I’d give it a go.  I have very sensitive skin and I am always so dry and itchy after showers with normal soap and body washes. I feel so clean after using this soap and I smell really good.\n",
            "Probably great for your skin but DAMN DOES THIS SMELL BADSo after going with the pine tar I received it yesterday and at first glance I wasn’t in love with the smell but still gave it a chance, after two washes I literally had to stop using it because it smells like stale mustard I don’t really see this being some thing someone would use for scent at all. It honestly makes me smell worse. I’d rather smell like BO then to smell like this\n",
            "Within seconds of using the soap, my biceps grew 12 inches, I had a three foot long beard, and no matter where I went there was the sound of screeching heavy metal guitars.  I had become too powerful for my own good thanks to this soap, I felt as if I could punch Thanos himself (aiming for the head of course) and summon lightning from my fingers.  I had harnessed the power of the Squatch.\n"

The price is a little higher then I would normally pay for a bar of soap; however, it lasts longer than any soap my father has had and it’s made here in the states, which I find kind of nice. So, if those two don’t buy the soap again, you can be sure that I will gift them both more soap next Christmas.\n",
            "I like this one best for how it makes my skin feel. A little pricey but worth it if you are paranoid like me about putting chemicals on you body.\n",
            "Great smell! Makes my skin feel good. BUT for the price not worth it to me. I used this as my daily now for about a week and it’s almost 50% gone. Wouldn’t but again for the price and as long as it last. That’s why it got a two and I think I’m being generous with that rating.\n",
            "Has a nice lather with a real natural oils scent that leaves your skin moisturized. On the pricey side for sure but you can tell it’s high quality and worth it.\n",
            "I bought the 3 pack- Pine Tar, Citrus Cedar, Gold Moss. I started with the Pine Tar, smelled good, left my skin a little dry.. but it the bar only lasted ONE WEEK with once a day use.. if you want a good lather like they advertise it would last a few days.The other 2 smelled good as well, they were less drying on my skin but not moisturizing. Both the Citrus Cedar & Gold Moss bars lasted about 10-12 days each MAX.This soap is just waaaay too expensive for how little you get out of it. I won’t be buying again unless they cut the price in half, or fix this issue!\n",
            "Soap is really good at moisturizing. Lather is good. But, wasn't there supposed to be a smell? Seriously. The soap has no scent at all. The box didn't even have a smell other than cardboard. I got bay rum and nautical sage and neither bar had a smell at all. After watching all of the ads for this soap we were really looking forward to trying it only to be let down.\n",
            "$30 on 3 bars. I expected it to smell as strong as axe bodywash. Pine tar smells like lighter knot with a hint of camphor. It actually has pine chips in the bar but it's not enough to exfoliate, it just scratches. Leaves the skin feeling about like ivory $1 a bar.. The gold moss doesn't smell as strong as pine tar. The Cedar citrus, i haven't  opened on the shelf. Going back to Duke cannon soap.\n",
            "I purchased this for my husband for Christmas mainly because of the YouTube commercials.

Definitely not worth the money.\n",

            "Overall I am pleased with how well the soaps works (cleanliness, moisturizing, comfort, smell, etc..) while I have soap. My biggest gripe is that the bar seems to shrink faster than I would have expected. While 2 of the 3 bars smell fairly strong if you hold the bar to your nose, I've found that it is not too intense while using and afterwards.\n",

The oatmeal inside of it really digs into skin to remove all dead or dry skin and really leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh. It only really suds up if you have a lot of body hair. However, the huge issue here is that the soap was basically gone by the end of my fourth shower and that the smell was nothing of pine tar. My wife described it as the most generic \"clean\" smell you can think of. Would not recommend.\n",

            "Great soap, I was lucky enough to make it last roughly 2 months. I manage to make it last so long by keeping it in a soap tin to not let any stray drippings go down the wall. If you use a loofah or wash cloth, wet it, then rub one it on the soap in the tin, you will get more than enough for cleaning.That being said, after the first month the bar started to dissolve, but because I kept it in a tin, I didn't lose any. As a liquid/paste, it still works.I'm writing a reveiw as I'm ordering my next bar. Just do a little rub, enough to get the color on your wash cloth, don't try to scoop. Its quality soap, really great.\n",
            "Soap scents are excellent and nice variety, but unfortunately a bit too pricey for something that does not last long. Have to remove bar of soap from the shower and place in a soap dish due to expanding the life of the soap and some are messier than others. Not a huge inconvenience, but prefer to leave all products in the shower for less clutter on the sink. Also, am not impressed with the Dr. Squatch web site. Cannot find anything that says \"Recent Orders\" and keep getting emails that claim I still have items in cart and need to be processed, which already were when I placed my last order. Site is not very user friendly in my opinion. All in all I still prefer Dollar Shave Club.\n",
            "I love this soap. Smells and feels fantastic. The bar size is quite small and doesn't last as long for the price. Would like to see the bar doubled in thickness for the same price.\n",
            "It smells amazing all natural only thing is I’ve never had a bar of soap dissipate so quickly I shower daily  because I work out.  And the bar go so quickly.  It I did love the scent and that it is all natural. It’s bar about every 2.5 to 3 weeks\n",
            "Smells great, works great, but didn't even last longer than a week. I made sure to dry it, but it just didn't last. If you want to spend 7-10 (you can find it for 7 on their website) bucks a week on soap, go for it. I have cheaper soap that easily lasts me twice to three times as long.\n",
            "The soap was recommended by a friend, I saw it had amazing reviews so I gave it a shot. The bar of soap That’s $10 didn’t last me past 8 showers. Psh what to expensive for a 6 day Urinal cake smelling bar of soap\n",
            "Let me tell you about this soap. Holy high heavens, it is spectacular. I enjoy a long day of being a smelly guy and then when I get home, I take a long, hot shower to collect myself and be one with my thoughts. I have many thoughts, like that one time in 8th grade when Tommy pulled my hair and make me snort like a pig until he was satisfied. I always thought about that. Until I then, one day, enjoyed a nice round of intercourse with his wife on their bed, where he lay at night. All thanks to this soap.Thanks, Dr. Squatch!\n",

            "First like, was your ad campaign, I am currently using Gold Moss Scrub, Second Like, is how clean I feel after it’s use. Third like is how appealing the scent is to my wife.I do heavy construction, so dirt and grime are just the norm for me and your product met and exceeded my expectations. If the other two bars are of the same quality, I can safely say that your product will be my soap of choice from here on out.Please let me know if you branch out into other male hygiene products.It’s refreshing that your product is all natural and not over saturated with unnecessary chemicals and solvents, I get exposed to enough of that crap in my chosen profession as it is.\n",

I also bought two other scents of bars which I've yet to try but if your on the fence about trying this soap I'm telling you its well worth it. And the scent is amazing and best of all these bars are all natural!\n",
            "I really like this soap’s scent, and overall properties.. What I don’t like, is how it looks after 2.5 weeks of use. Loses it structural integrity and makes a mess.\n",
            "I was excited to use this soap. Love and support the idea behind it. The color, texture and scent are wonderful. Unfortunately. I found the bar broke down much too quickly leaving behind a great deal of residue. My biggest gripe is of the price point. Sure, it’s a nice treat, but not budget wise. I suppose it’s a give and take, but not that intriguing of a product to resume my purchasing.\n",
            "This soap was pretty good. Doesn't leave your skin feeling dry and cracked like dial, irish spring, ect. Smells awesome, made in usa, all that good stuff. But for real, I took 6 showers with this bar and it was gone. I would buy again for camping/travel or some other novelty purpose, but not for everyday use. Although I will add that if it were in my budget to spent about $1.50 per shower on soap, this would be my choice.\n",
            "This product is fantastic. It feels delightful as you lather, it exfoliates like no other, but there's one tiny drawback: the scent. It doesn't really smell like pine tar to me, which I've used in shampoos before, but instead smells to me just like the bathroom cleaner Comet. The smell doesn't stay at all, likely thanks to the charcoal, but instead leaves you feeling super clean and refreshed. I really like this soap! I am fine that it isn't the best smell ever, but it's still a great experience.\n",
            "I ordered for my boyfriend. He likes the scents and the soap. I’m a convert and now use “his” soap too!So far we like them all. I definitely recommend.\n"

            "I love how it smells and leaves you very clean without drying your skin out. However the bar was a bit smaller than anticipated and that is my only gripe. I wish that Squatch would make a 10 ounce bar like Duke Cannon, or even a tad bit bigger than it already is. All and all it is a great product and oddly enough, it does smell like you're taking a stroll through a pine forest with Scarlet Johansson.\n",
            "We ordered the pine tar, and it smells like mushrooms. Your skin is very soft after you wash with it, but the smell I cant get over.\n",
            "To my surprise I believe this is thee best smelling bar of soap I have ever bought. As soon I opened the box it's as if a pine tree had sprouted, raining downing glorious spring showers. Not to mention how the bar felt, the sweet soft lather and the salt scrub was as if I was sitting on the shore of a beach and all my troubles were just washing away. Once my shower was finished the scent of pine tar wasn't. It stays with you like a good friend when you're in troubled times. 10 out of 10 wouldn't be a close enough scale as to recommend buying this soap let's try 100 out of 10, and if this review doesn't satisfy you then try it yourself and leave one. You won't be disappointed.\n",
            "Mostly a great product but for its price it disintegrates really really fast even using a soap saver. Not worth the money if you have to buy a new bar ever other week\n",
            "The smell is very potent, my husband did not mind it, but I'm the one who had to smell it and it was definitely not my favorite scent. The soap size was perfect for the amount, however... it barely lasted 2 weeks. And we have the soap saver. So it was disappointing. The soap however is the first bar soap he has ever liked as far as the over all feeling left behind.\n",
            "1 bar lasts maybe a week. The scent does not stay on you at all. The soap is overrated and over priced. I'll stick with my Irish spring\n",
            "When I opened the box that came in the mail with my pine tar soap, I was amazed by how awesome it smelled as I opened the box. Using it for the first time in the shower made me smell like a woodland tree elf, swinging from tree to tree like tarzan. When they say it lathers, it fricken lathers. Bow hunting season is almost here, pine tar is going to allow me to smell like the trees so I blend in like a tree that blends in with other trees.\n",
            "I always give things a try. I bought the 3 pack. They smell nice but they dont make you smell nice. They dry out my skin. Arms were ashy. Pine tar was rough loved that. Smells all great but my wife didn't noticed.  Started back with old spice she noticed. Sorry guys I will not be buying you're product again\n",
            "Nicely packaged and good texture to the soaps.  I have only used the pine-tar so far, but all of them seem well made and had good aromas.  I did follow the advice to split up the bars so as to avoid losing more than necessary to being wet/weathered in the shower.  The pine-tar left me with a good (and not overbearing) aroma all day.\n",

            "I can’t believe I’m saying this but after a week of using Pine Tar, it is just like I saw in Dr Squatch commercials.... I smell like a real man being handed a bar of soap by Sasquatch. I am more than pleased with my purchase and will become a repeat customer.\n",

            "Husband loves it, but I can not get over the smell! I hate it!! He got the other pack to try different scents and they are way better!\n",
            "My husband has very dry and sensitive skin. This soap has helped him tremendously and Will be the only product he purchases for body washing.\n",
            "The exfoliating that it does to your skin feels so good. It really buffs your skin and gives you a super clean feeling. The scent is less than I expected but I’m okay with that because of the clean feeling that I had after the shower. Will definitely be putting this on a monthly order list.\n",
            "I've never bought bar soap for myself before this. So I don't have anything to compare it to. But i really like it. Gives a deep clean without the residue. Smells great, and lasts for quite a while.\n",
            "It makes my skin feel clean not slimy like a body wash does. My wife likes the smell and it lasts a long time if you use a scrubber thing to wash with.  Just make sure to let it dry out in between showers and you can cut it in half if you choose. And make it last longer I recommend this one and the mixed set is cheaper per bar if you get the larger one.\n",
            "For a bar of soap that cost what it does it sure doesn’t last long!! Kept seeing this soap all over Facebook ads and some YouTube ads. So I thought I would give it a try. As far of smell and over all feel after a shower, it was good. However the bar barely lasted a week before fall apart. I may have a shower or two left and then I’ll be back to my old soap!Overall not worth the money!\n",

            "I was first intrigued to purchase one of Dr. Squatch soap products from their well done and funny commercial. But before signing up for a soapscription I wanted to try it and let me just say wow, I'am a believer. The scent for the Pine Tar is absolutely breathtaking. Feels comfortable in my hands and as I washing my body, and smelling the Pine Tar it really did feel like I was taking a shower behind a pine tree in the woods. My skin, holy sh*t feels new. I'll be honest it feels very weird to have my skin feel like this, gentle and soft. But I can use to this. I will definitely being signing up for a soapscription.\n",

            "Pros:-smells great (smells very fresh. Vaguely minty)-feels nice (I love the grittiness)-way better than the slimy feeling of shower gelCons:-bar is too small. would last about two weeks if you use it for your whole body-for two weeks if bar soap, $7 is pretty expensive. Duke Cannon bars are $3 more, and about 4x as big, but don't smell or feel as nice.\n",

            "This soap is well made and smells amazing. There is light pumice in the bar, and the lather is nice and thick. While the price is high, this handmade soap  is well worth the price. The bar is quite large. I will definitely recommend it to friends and family.\n",
            "The sent Simon point smells amazing like really good lol. As far as for sensitive skin I'd say no because its rough on skin, and as far as moisturizing I'd have to say no as well I feel like it kinda drys my skin out less than my last soap. But I do like the sent of the soap and I'm going to be trying more of them to see the difference in the different bars. I would recommend this to people because everyone's body reacts differently so give it a shot.\n",
            "I told him to use a washcloth. The smell is nice, doesn’t irritate anyone’s skin if you use a washcloth or loofa.\n",

The bars I received came in under the promised 4.8  which for the cost is somewhat disappointing and was the reason I gave a 3 star rating. I have showered for 4 days with the soap and seems to be disappearing rapidly regardless of leaving the soap in an area where it can dry out.\n",

I've read many reviews and am curious as to how others soaps last so short? I lather my body lightly with the soap (careful not to waste) and then follow up with an axe body scrubber and the exfoliation and lather is great. Now if your lathering your entire body solely with the soap it will run out faster. Also, if you rub it on a body scrubber than scrub your body it will also run out very fast. The method I use easily lasts me a month and I shower twice daily. Only thing keeping it from five stars is that it is kind of expensive and the bar is small. If used right though it will lastHope this helps.\n",
            "Really good soap.  Smells good feels good.  I like the scratch it's not too much it feels nice to me.  Only thing is it get visually smaller every shower.  Doesn't last long at all, but that's the only thing I can say for cons.  Good soap.\n",

            "Good soap but very overpriced.  The smell grows on you.  The exfoliants look like shards of glass; I'm not sure that it's a very effective approach to exfoliating your skin.  I got about 2 weeks out of a bar.\n",
            "The soap smelled great and felt good but it only lasted one week. A little expensive for a product to be gone so fast.\n",
            "The soap smells nice and exfoliates very well.  The drawback is it doesnt last long.  7 showers and its gone.  I dont recommend thus as a daily soap. Maybe use Bay Rum as your daily and this weekly to exfoliate.\n",

            "Honestly a very decent bar of soap. Smells great with a very nice rich lather. Does not leave scum on the skin and the scent lasts for most of the day. You can really tell it’s naturally made because they’re is what I assume is bits of pine pressed into the soap, giving it a very rugged, bumpy feel after the first use. I don’t recommend it for sensitive skin but I can’t complain about the great scent and very rich lather. Doesn’t last very long but they sell a soap saver so I assume that would help with its longevity.\n",
            "I like the soap but my woman friend says the scent is too strong and I should try the lighter scents.\n",
            "This soap lasts a week at best. At $10 a bar individually that’s $520/yr for soap. Buying in a 3 pack saves you a little but not much. This stuff is way over priced and I can’t encourage strongly enough that you should stay away from this product unless it were to st least halve in price.\n",

            "The scent of this soap is really good. I like when my boyfriend uses this. I would suggest buying a soap dish or it will leave black color all over your shower and the soap will run out faster. The black color is easy to wash off but I would still get a soap dish for this\n",

Though birth certificate states I'm 4 years old my manly appearance has forced my parents to enroll me in college just to continue my education. The soap is soft and gritty, good for scrubbing. Smells Good and did leave my skin feeling softer, even for a child.\n",
            "Bought this for my husband and he was a fan for the most part. However, the bar of soap lasted almost two weeks. It dissolves very fast. The smell is alright. Definitely not a pine tar smell like expected but still smells good. Will most likely buy again.\n",

My husband broke out all over his body, but in all fairness he does get contact dermatitis rashes with certain products so if you have sensitive skin you may want to avoid the pine tar flavor and go for another scent/type. I’m sure their other scents smell lovely.\n",
            "2 stars, that is it.  The Pine Tar scent smells okay, at best.  It does exfoliate good, almost too good.  Can be very scratchy on the skin.  Also my main gripe is the soap doesn't last at all. For a $10 bar of soap, this is a MAJOR disappointment.  I'd rather spend $4 on 8 bars of store bought soap and have it last.  Maybe other scents last longer?  Not worth trying another for $10.  Stay away.\n",
            "I bought the Pine Bar and it smells great in the shower but the scent doesn't really stick to your skin. The bar contains piece of pine that scratch your skin but leaves no marks of scratches. I also tried to see if the bar would help reduce face and body acne and I saw no difference. I would say if you have the money to throw and try this product go for it, but if money is tight its not worth it.\n",
            "Great scent, but way too abrasive. I needed to be careful lathering the bar or else I’d wind up with red scratches on my body that I’d notice after getting out of the shower. Just a little overkill on using both sand and oats. If you want a gentle exfoliation, this bar is not for you. Skin was a little dry after using, but not nearly like it would’ve been with cheaper bar soaps.\n",
            "So after the first 2 uses this soap gets super soft and basically falls apart. Doesn't last but maybe 8 showers.\n",
            "Loved the scent of the soap and great lather. The soap has pieces of wood in it for exfoliating and they are way too sharp. So sharp skin was cut once.  The black color looks cool until there is constant black streaks running down your white shower wall.\n",
            "For as expensive as this is I would have expected it to actually have a smell. I might as well use dish soap to bathe.\n",
            "The pine tar bar doesn’t even smell like pine. It smells like pinesol. I was kinda disappointed when i got it. $10 for a small bar that didn’t even smell like pine. After drying off, you smell like baby powder. Maybe it was just my bar? The Bar only lasted a week and the pinesol smell lasted only 2 days then it had i would guess a baby powder smell remaining to it.\n",
            "Really wanted to like this soap. This sounds like a weird critique but its just overly scented. I thought I would like the pine tar scent but I left the shower smelling like I poured pine-sol all over my body. It definitely doesn't lather up the way they presented it on the ads. They for sure used a loofa then acted like the bar lathered up that way. Dang, just dang.\n",
            "Great soap! Doesn’t last long though. Soap holder would definitely help, but still doesn’t last long.\n",

My elbows have gone from large patchy dry skin to almost nothing in a month of use. I will never use another soap again. I LOVE THIS SOAP Dr. Squatch thank you. Now if only i could get your Hair Products :) (out of stock right now) maybe look into deodorant as well maybe?\n",

Its a good size too.I bought the soap off the commercial on youtube. The marketing is super well done.That said, these guys would be smart to get the price down on this soap as soon as possible. $5 makes a lot more sense that $10. Even as boutique bars of soap go, this is expensive.I love it, but the cost is prohibitive.\n",

Made my bathroom smell amazing, it’s not a generic pine tree air freshener smell,  very pleasant. The soap works wonders, felt straight up clean and my woman loved the feel of my skin... the ONLY reason for 4/5 stars is its hard to justify $9 for a bar of soap that lasts as long as any other bar...

Also, this thing doesn't last nearly as much as it should. And it has this weird solid things in it, for exfoliating I suppose, so it will probably hurt someone who has a sensitive skin.

The only drawback I have is the smell doesn't stick with you for a while after use but that's the ONLY thing I have so you can say I'm just nitpicking. Pine tar will smell your bathroom up and make you feel like you are chopping down trees with Paul Bunyan. GREAT JOB DR. SQUATCH\n",

            "This is my second time ordering this specific bar of soap. I was very pleased with it The first time and it is now my daily shower soap. I not only use it for my body but I use it for my beard. I have some trouble with beard dandruff ( especially in the winter) and read online that this might help... It did! I can wholeheartedly this is sosp to one who's looking for a natural alternative to beard care. The soap doesn't last as long as a standard bar of soap but is a necessary trade-off when you're looking for something with natural ingredients. The bar and even the packaging are high quality!\n",

He's been using it for about a week now, and the bar is halfway gone, but that goes to show that it doesn't have any extra hidden ingredients.

I’ve always stuck with name brand kind my whole life but after seeing their manly yet hilarious ads on YouTube about natural soaps, I just had to give them a try and was not disappointed. It has a much better scent to it that store brands like Dove and Irish Spring don’t and you leave the shower feeling all kinds of good. You can consider my a returning customer and I recommend their products to anyone! Heck, I may even soapscribe after another purchase.\n",

It doesn't really leave a scent on the body which is all preference, it has a scent that reminds me of pinesol but not something that sticks to the body. As far as the exfoliation of the bar I've tried multiple bars of but havent experienced anything that helps exfoliate like this bar of soap, I assume it's the combination of pine tar and the little chunks in the bar. It's awesome. My only complaint, is that the bar is too small for the price natural soaps go faster than non natural soaps but are far superior for the skin so that isn't an issue, so it would be nice if the bar was at least twice as big.\n",

            "The soap is dark black and stains the soap holder in the shower. It smells good, but not much of the smell actually transfers to your body. It doesn't lather well and it's full of greenery and twigs (?) for exfoliation.  It's literally like rubbing sticks against your body.  Not a pleasant experience.  Good marketing, but sub-par product.\n",
            "I finally tried this soap after all the bombarded ads on YouTube, when this soap had arrived it had a generic pine smell which smelled fine nothing amazing. This has bits of wood that are more abrasive then a unshaven you know what and if you leave this soap in a small puddle of water this soap will turn like a old lady’s you know what hanging like sleeve of wizard. This soap lasted no longer then an old man doing you know what I’m the bedroom. Overall waste of $10 I could have spent on you know what\n",

It has a good smell to it when using this soap but the scent does not stay with you like I had hoped or like other products I have used.  I am not sure how long it will last. I have only used it once.\n",
            "It arrived earlier than anticipated, I love the soap it smells great and makes me feel fresh. I was gifted a starter with three different soaps, I intended to use your citrus bar after but I'm a Greek guy I have enough olive oil in me for generations I don't need any help moisturizing. I love that the pine tar exfoliates and really eats oils, definitely going to be returning.\n",
            "It only lasted 10 days!Didn’t smell like much, like they show on Snapchat; “coming out of the shower smelling great!”. I have sensitive skin and I felt my skin dry and itchy coming out of the shower. I also had some mild irritation (little bumps)I wanted to like this product but I’ll stick to my dove OR up and up knock off brand. $6 for 8 bars...\n",
            "it smells good but thats about all it was good for. I used the whole bar up in less then a week. the cost is too high for soap that I would need to buy 5 of them just to get though the month.\n",
            "My husband has been using the same bath products since he was a teenager because his skin would break out whenever he tried something new. At 36, he has a great variety of products and scents to try out! (Also, not gonna lie, these smell really sexy)\n",

Id say a 3.5Bar should be 30% larger.\n",
            "Nice smelling soap but once again I use the reviews to buy and is it worth $ 10 not in my opinion. It does smell nice but not 10 dollars. Sorry am just being honest.\n",
            "My new favorite soap...... this soap even has a bit of sand in it to exfoliate your skin and I tell you, you come out the shower feeling nice, and the smell is out of this world good....... definitely going to be my daily soap from now on!!!!\n",
            "Is a very good product, but it just doesn't last long enough.  Didn't think the value was there for the price.\n",
            "This soap is just what the doctor ordered. Dr. Squatch!I have been using the cheapo shower gel type \"soap\" for a long time. I received a variety three-pack.  After using it, my skin feels better and not itchy. Ingredients are awesome and real and the smell is great.\n",
            "Overpriced soap is all it is.  But the ads are hilarious so I bought it to try it out. Con: There is no lasting smell to it so you will never leave the house smelling like a \"man\".  It actually must have women repellent in it. Stupid soap! Pro: It lathers real nice and the broken glass in it does exfoliate the skin nicely.  I'll probably try another type of Dr. Squatch's overpriced soap in a different scent after this one to see what its like.\n",
            "I really do like the soap a lot. Skin feels much better with this soap than all the body washes I’ve used.Only con I have is that i love the scent of the soaps but never have that scent on me after I get out. Have one more bar to try to see if that changes. I want to try the rum one out also. I don’t want the scent to be overpowering but at least have my body smell like what I washed with.I would buy again because I feel it is much better for your skin than other body washes out there.\n",
            "Good sized bars, and the scents are great. It also doesn’t leave any residue on my skin. I will purchase again.\n",

I think part of it is that it lathers very well (almost too well) and then it ends up shrinking quicker than I anticipated. However, its not that big of a deal, so I am still pleased with the soap.\n",

            "I love your nautical sage and pine tar soaps however I got a package with a couple others that caused serious irritation. It caused me to chafe terribly which is surprising for a soap containing natural ingredients. I am also extremely dissatisfied with how long the soap lasts. This soap is incredibly expensive and it seems to almost melt away in the shower even when used as economically as possible.\n",
            "Smells amazing. Makes a great gift for any man in your life. Great for all skin types. Love the branding.\n",
            "Barely lasted a week, not really worth the money. A rough calculation would be 1$ a day of use. It also being black had stained the walls of my shower, now I have to clean haha.\n",
            "The soap smells great, but I don’t feel it’s does anything for my dry skin. Also, when I stored some for a month before using it, it became soft and stuck to its container/ box. I could only remove it by losing a lot of the soap in process. Also, in its softened state, it became almost runny.\n",
            "No I'm not one to complain especially about soap but I'm going to tell you anyway the product that they show on the infomercial I would have loved to purchase that I got some clay based scented candle knock off as a bar of soap I was there for about an hour trying to make a lather I mean. It some what lathers than it dissipates my body didn't feel any smoother after the shower either I'll stick with my antibacterial Dial soap suds Galore kills all the germs smells good and a fraction of the price!\n"

This time I wanted to try out all the types of soaps Dr. Squatch has to offer and just by smelling each and everyone, I can say that I will not  be disappointed.  I agree that it is a little more expensive than your average soap and that it does not last long (in my case 5- 9 days tops) so if you are looking for a lasting product and not the experience of trying new things, this is not for you.\n",
            "This soap smells good and the scent lasts most of the day on your skin. It doesn’t seem the greatest for moisturizing but I still like it regardless.\n",
            "Decent soap. Make sure to keep it out of water or it will just melt away really quickly. Not really worth the price tbh. If it was priced at $5/bar then I would definitely recommend it.\n",
            "Out of all the Dr. Squatch soaps I've bought for him, this one seems to be the top pick. While \"Pine Tar\" sounds less than appealing to me, I think it actually smells the best and he seems to dig it as much as he's able. :) His only real concern with soap is how much I like the smell.\n",
            "Ok lathers wonderful! Definitely a woodsy man smell that my wife can’t enough of but it’s kinda weird soon as I rinse my skin feels tacky all over but soon as I dry skin soft as ever! But it does the job I work in a dirty oily machine shop and gets me clean!\n",
            "Paid $10 for a bar and it was gone within 2 weeks. No difference in moisture then any other soap that I paid $.25 for. I would buy if it was maybe a $1-2 a bar.And scent was different but just okay.\n",
            "I bought the variety pack to see which scent I like the best. but instead of 3 different scents I got one Gold Moss and two Pine Tar\n",
            "It smells great! Literally lasts a matter of DAYS! It just dissolves once water touches it. I was honestly shocked when I saw it after a day or two of use... I thought “what happened to it?” I tried the other two that came in the set- same thing. 1 bar lasted less than a week and I don’t even take long showers.\n",

I purchased the tar pine black soap just to try it 1st week was ok but the second was horrible this soap will make you break out in hives all over your body it not only does this but the bar of soap feels like you are scrubbing with wood particles in the soap. I will never buy the soap again.\n",

In the Shower, the smell is strong and intense.. But only lasts until you step out the restroom door. The soap itself, as expensive at it is, only lasts a few days.\n",

It doesn’t smell very strong. And 1 bar is lucky to last you a week as it dissipates very quickly. Not worth the price you pay.\n",

            "The soaps smell great and I do really enjoy using them. Bars are small, but I find they last a long time. However, like all natural soaps, they will dry your skin out. This may be a benefit if you have oily skin, but I can't reccomend washing your face with it.\n",

Currently I've been buying soap from a local shop, where it's hand made with natural ingredients. For a 4oz bar I pay about 7 dollars. They offer really good scents, and a wide variety. I think I'll be going back to those. If they offered a three pack for 20, or 22 dollars I might be back.\n",

The bar is a little pricy $10 for one but I think I will be willing to pay. This is an excellent product and its not often that you use a bar of soap and actually feel CLEAN. Makes your skin feel and smell great, excellent lather. For the reviews saying that it didnt last, I have been using it for 11 days and I still have at least half the bar so I wouldnt be surprised if it lasted me the rest of the month, plus a little more and I usually shower twice a day during the week.\n",
            "It smells really good when using it in the shower but you dont smell the odor to and it did not last long. We can use the $1.00 Zest and it last longer than the $26 soap. Not happy I spent $26 on 3 bars of soap and it didn't last long. He maybe used it 10 ten times before the soap started to break into pieces.\n",

We also have a joke between us about big foot, so this will be a great gift and it is just as described. Though there was a mishap with Amazon's shipping, the soap arrived in good time and there was great communication. The smell is a little stronger than my husband may like, but it smells wonderfully of pine. I will gift it to another family member if he doesn't like it.

Thought maybe scent would change when in use yea no my girlfriend walked into the bathroom to ask if i was cleaning the shower. Didn't even fully wash my body with this, I stopped showering just to throw the soap in the trash and grab a bar of Marlowe.\n",

I so wanted to love this product, but i'll stick to my old soap i reckon. Not worth the ten bucks. Dr. Squatch, get on it. The bar needs to be twice the size to warrent the tenner. Disappointed.\n",

I actually though something was wrong because my skin didn't feel like paper. Amazing product, love it.\n",

Most of my other generic bars have lasted me a good 15 20 or sometimes more. I will say that it left my skin feeling very nice, just wish it lasted longer for its high price point..\n",

            "I really enjoyed this soap and had a great smell that lasted much longer than traditional soaps you'd get at a store. Usually soap drys out my skin and ends up making me peel. This one does not do that and does it extremely well for my sensitive skin. The only complaint id have was the initial rough feel of the soap but i kinda expected that. Other than that it was a great purchase and will stick with this soap for awhile.\n",
            "I bought into the whole pinetar rugged barsoap thing. It's a cool looking bar of soap and the rough pieces in it were nice for scrubbing but they were only on one side of the bar and not many either. Smell was good also. I like the soap but unfortunately would not recommended buying it. I've used the soap 5 times and can get max 2 more showers out of it.  $10 soap for 7 showers? No thanks.\n",

Dr. Squatch not only keeps his face and back completly clean and clear there is no harshness or oily residue. I absolutely recommend this company and its products!\n",
            "I have only been able to use one of the soap bars so far...lasts a long time! I am using the black tar scrub and liking it so far.\n",
            "My main problem with this bar soap is how long it will last. Even after one shower usage, this bar of soap will significantly reduce in size. Even if you leave the soap on the designated soap rack in your shower, heat combined with moisture is enough to initiate volume reduction. Although on the contrary, this bar soap does leave your skin feeling great.\n",
            "It smells good. It makes me feel like a man.. girls nipples get hard after the smell as my research has discovered\n",
            "after arriving from being lost in shipping I like the bars of soap. They all smell very good and feel great on skin.\n",
            "This soap is awesome, not only that, the Pine Tar flavor smells amazing too.  You cant get much more manlier than with the blackest black bar of soap that smells like the woods.  No more of this body wash nonsense for this guy, this soap lathers far better and doesn't leave that waxy feeling that most others do.  If this soap doesn't want to make you grow a beard, dust that old flannel off and build a log cabin with your bare hands, then I cant help you.\n",
            "My husband loves these soaps! Just wish we could buy a value pack without the pine tar. He said the pine tar is pretty impossible to get off in the shower. Just feels like it stays on. Otherwise, he absolutely loves them and I just ordered more but, had to in 2 single orders.\n",
            "I want to love this soap, but you will possibly have a cost of around $40 a month to use this product on a daily basis. Regardless of a draining soap dish, which I was using, as others have recommended. Also, the fragrance is great, but doesn't last very long. Pine tar review\n",
            "The smell of this soap is great! I just wish the scent would last a bit longer or remain more pronounced. Still highly recommend as it may just be me!\n",

            "I’ve been in love with this product ever since the Facebook ads popped up on my phone. As a Manley man, I need a soap that’s as strong as I am. This is definitely a nice sturdy bar of soap. Although, I was promised that I would smell like the forest, but the pine tar I received twice now doesn’t do me such justice. I still love the product, but I wish the pine-scent was much stronger so it smelled like I rubbed pine needles all over my body. In conclusion, love this product, 9.5/10. 0.5 will come if my next bar makes me smell like I lived in a pine tree for 10 years.\n",
            "For years i’ve used body wash and my skin always stayed dry and itchy. I never realized how much damage the harmful chemicals were doing to my skin.....until one use of this soap. I’ve never felt anything like it. I wasn’t a fan of the pine tar because the black can leave a mess in the shower but all the others are great!!\n",
            "This product dried out my skin, very scratchy. I was not impressed with the smell.\n",
            "First off, I feel like the soap did it’s job. I felt clean after use, no scummy residue on my skin or anything. I’ve used it twice, and really think that it has softened my skin a bit. Secondly, which is equally important to me, it doesn’t smell great. After reading reviews I was under the impression that this is a great clean smelling bar of soap. It’s not. It doesn’t stink, but it won’t leave a freshly bathed scent either. To me the price vs value just doesn’t add up. I’ll stick to my generic great smelling Irish Spring.\n",
            "This product is terrible!!! Don't waste your money I am talking about the Pine Tar soap thought I would give it a try very disappointing!!! this stuff Stunk so Bad I had to use my regular soap to cover it up. Waste of Money! Buyer beware. Regards, Taken for a Ride\n",

I have never seem a man so moved by the little soap wooden pallet thingy either.  He proudly displays all his soaps around the bath tub.I have to say his skin is very soft though, soaps are very moisturing and the smells are awesome.\n"

It would also bleed every where especially when water spash on it. That  wasn't worth it two me. That's why I gave it four stars.\n",

Great stuff but as others have said, one bar doesn't last very long, but that may be due to it being natural. So far I've liked all of Dr. Squatch scents except bay rum.\n",

Don’t get me wrong the scent is great but I expected so much more but it turned out to be yet another overhyping well advertised product. And there answer to the soap not lasting is to buy a 20 dollar soap holder? For a bar of soap? No thanks.\n",
            "The scent of this bar was amazing! Strong and long lasting scent, but left my skin dry afterwards. I usually use Dove bar soap and that has never left my skin dry and itchy. I wouldn’t say it’s good for sensitive skin either.\n",
            "I really like the soap but it just doesn’t last long.  I’m the only person using the soap and I bought a 3 pack and went through a bar every 2 weeks.  Leaves soap scum too, I’d recommend offering a soap tray in your 3 pack.\n",

Not only has my bar of soap lasted me over a month (probably will last a little over 5 weeks), but is the best smelling soap I've ever used. I shower every day, and three days out of the week I always shower twice in a day. I have no idea why people say this bar of soap only lasts a week, they must be using/storing it wrong.\n",

Try the different versions.  The pine tar one has a unique smell after it gets wet.  It’s not bad, it’s more expensive than the big names but you can tell the ingredients are top notch.\n"

Cloth will spread soap and you use less and achieve same result. Store in container with drainage to prevent water from deteriorating your soap after use, etc.\n",

My only regret is not savoring the moment longer.\n",

It smells slightly woodsy on your skin after using it (which is what I expected), but the smell of the bar and during use is a very, very strong medicinal scent. The scent is extremely loud while in use. I paid too much to throw it away, so I’m dealing with the gross smell while showering. Can’t attest to the amount of time the bar will last yet since I’ve only used it twice, but it was dripping a lot in the shower so probably not long.\n",

With that being said, I just can't justify the price. 10 dollars for a bar that lasted for about a weeks worth of showers. I understand that this is all natural hand made organic soap so it's going to be a bit pricey, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 3.\n",

The bars do disintegrate a bit faster than a normal bar, the pine tar one I'm currently using is about halfway gone, at a rate of a shower a day for a week. Overall, an outstanding product if you like soap bars, though it may cost a bit more to keep buying if they last two to three weeks at a time.\n"

            "PROS:  Smells decent, cleans well, doesn't irritate or dry out my skin like store bought soap, scent doesn't irritate my wife's allergies.CONS:  Feels like sand paper, costs way too much for one bar, seems like it might not last long, not the same smell as the pine tar soap I'm used to.OTHER THOUGHTS:My wife ordered this soap for me and so far I've only been able to shower with it once (it only just arrived today).  The soap smells ok, but not as good as Grandpa's Pine Tar soap (I like the camp fire smell of Gpas).  It also costs significantly more than Grandpa's.  The soap has sand in it, so it literally feels like rubbing sandpaper all over your body.  I tried three different lather methods; a washcloth, hands, and just scrubbing with the bar and all three felt like sandpaper.  I ended up getting some in my eye when washing my face and it took 10 minutes to get the sand out.CONCLUSION:Considering that this soap is not as good as Grandpa's Pine Tar soap and costs significantly more, I cannot in good conscience recommend it to anyone.  Perhaps one of the other soaps Dr. Squatch makes is better, I don't know.  After this bar runs out I'm switching back to Grandpa's.\n",

However, I’ve been seeing a lot of reviews saying it doesn’t last long and that is true, but I have found out is that I keep the bar soap itself and tray IN my room being that it’s made from natural ingredients I guess that it absorbs the humidity in the air and it adds about another week half\n",

            "I like the way this soap lathers up the scent and  how it rinses off. I don't like the abrasive feel to it. If it said that is was abrasive in the ad I missed it. If I did miss it, I will revise my rating to 4 stars.  Good for washing hands that have been working not good for me in the shower.\n",

I definitely am gonna get some more and try other varieties of it. Makes a great gift for any guy!\n",

Thanks doctor squatch! One thing u would request, is more of a roundish bar. The square Is a little edgy on the body.

The soap doesn't feel oily.. it smells great (used the cedar and citrus) but doesn't leave an overpowering fragrance after you're done which my girlfriend is particularly sensitive to.  If you're looking for an all natural, US made, soap that has a good but subtle scent this bar is for you.  At $8 a bar or so it's a little pricier than your typical store brand but well worth it considering how much soap you actually go through a year.  As an adult dude who showers at least once a day and usually twice it seems to last 2 weeks easily.  Probably closer to 3 or 4.  I will probably continue buying this for a while to come unless I stumble on a better product\n",

But In their defense I am a tall guy and shower most days 2 times. But won’t keep me from going back for more. Lathers like crazy, feel clean, and ladies complimented the smell. I like that. I like the ladies, and now they almost break necks trying to catch a smell when I walk by.\n",
            "Hello Jack, I just received the sub, and I’ve used it for a few days to shower. I really like it a lot, the scent is just enough without being too noticeable and smells good. But the best thing is it seems to leave the smooth coating  on my skin, without that oily feeling that some soaps can give you . I really like the all natural ingredients, I’m trying to upgrade my life, and do things in a more healthy way, and your soap is a part of that. I really appreciate your product and would definitely recommend it and buy it again. Thank you\n",

            "The soap is pretty good. The scent is fine though the more solid ingredients felt weird on my skin and was kinda rough. The biggest downside is how expensive the soap is compared to the number of showers it lasts. There were $3 bars of soap that I got that lasted twice as long as this soap. If the price went down to anywhere between $3-$4 or if the soap was made about 3 times bigger then I would probably go back to this soap.\n",

It has bits in it that help with exfoliating and the smell is refreshing and great.I was a little nervous seeing people complaining about it dissolving. I keep this stored on a metal grate holder. It has not dissolved on me.Overall this is a great product and highly recommend it.\n",

It’s also SUPER abrasive, like rubbing 60 grit sandpaper on your body, but I like it that way since it gets all the dead skin and sweat off nicely 👌🏼 If you’re the kind of guy that showers after work, this is the soap for you 💪🏻\n",

The bad lasted 8 showers, left black residue on my shower wall that was hard to get off, soap would go from super smooth to sand paper like in one swipe, did I mentioned it only lasted 8 showers!!! Not a good soap but the smell is fantastic\n",

Great scent, lathered better than most soaps and leaves you feeling the cleanest you've been probably ever. I typically have very dry itchy skin and this soap has done amazingly well at not drying me out. Only small complaint is the bar only lasted a little over 2 weeks which makes this stuff a bit pricey. That said, order 5 bars and the value seems a lot better. Squatch soap, great name, great soap.\n",

I used to rely on lotions to help with the dry itchy skin patches that I would get (especially on my face), however these soaps have given me relief.  I normally do not buy into the \"all natural\" products but damn if this product doesn't do what it says.  Yes it is an actual soap, yes it is natural and for that you will pay a premium over \"soaps\" like Irish spring, but you save on needing lotion so... Yeah you basically break even in my book.  Try one bar and see what happens.\n",

            "I keep trying to figure out what that wonderful aroma following me everywhere is. Then I realize it's the great scent of myself from using this soap. My skin feels so smooth and moisturized after every shower. My quest to find the best soap brand for me is now over. Now I just need to find my go-to scent.\n",

Either way, the soap was all natural, and was an excellent product. 10/10 can make a warship smell like a pine forest.\n"

That night when I put away all of my xmas gifts I took it out of the box and put it in the shower.  The next morning I used it and that was all it took I was hooked. Great scent and I felt clean. It reminded me of when I was young and would stay at my grandmothers house.  She always made homemade soap.  Only hers did not have any scent.  So I ordered the tree pack when I started to get low.  I love it\n",

            "Was dubious about buying because so many reviews claimed it only lasted 1 week, but it's lasting for me. I've been using it for 3 weeks and probably have another 1 or 2 weeks left. As long as you don't over-lather and keep it in a dry spot, it lasts fine.The smell is great and it's also exfoliating. A tad expensive but it does feel more premium than the average bar of soap.\n",
            "Smells ok not as good as others I have tried. Small bar. I was expecting a lot better quality especially for the price 10$ soap should last at least 2 weeks and smell better.  Save your money buy difrent soap.\n",

The squared block and completely black color give it a great aesthetic and it has a robust scent and thick lather. If you keep it in the shower I would pair it up with their soap saver to keep it lasting longer. Overall, I'll buy it again although probably through their \"soapscription\" once I figure out how long it lasts.\n",

I take 2 showers a day and after 10 showers the soap is almost gone.I do not mind spending money for a quality item but at $10 per bar I would hope it would last longer\n",

            "Just got a bar if the pine tar soap. Absolutely awesome stuff. Straight out of the box, smells like pinesol cleaner which was worrisome. However, in the shower and after, oh yeah. Stuff smells great.  Then there's how great your skin feels after. I run a kitchen, and have to shower multiple times daily, and this is the only soap I've found that doesnt dry my skin out. Cant wait to try other scents.\n",

            "I don't often write product reviews, but when I ordered this soap I must admit I was in fact skeptical and a disbeliever. As I washed myself with this little square of heaven, I realized how much of a fool I was.I was suddenly overcome with a feeling of manliness, so much in fact that its not even 6am and I have already shaven twice for work. I smell nothing but Northern Forestry, and both women and men have been holding doors open for me and addressing me as \"sir\". I have the sudden urge to go out and buy as many pairs of brown wool pants, plaid long sleeve shirts and suspenders as possible, I live in Florida and on my way home from work today I'm pretty sure I'm going to buy an axe (double headed of course) go home and triumphantly cut down my neighbor's tree singlehandedly. As I do such a task for absolutely no reason beyond proving how much of a man this soap has made me I shall be drinking (fancilly of course being I'm no savage) 110 proof whisky on the rocks, literal rocks I've collected and chilled and smoking from a pipe I had just whittled beforehand.Buy this soap, don't be my neighbor and be stuck watching in awe as I slay his yard's topiary intruder for him.\n",

            "I was very eager to try this soap, I loved that it was handmade and pretty natural. It has a really good scent, it's not too strong and it doesn't smell like cologne like a lot of the Men's soaps. The scent is probably what I like best about it. It also suds up very well, especially for bar soap, the lather is awesome and it didn't make my skin feeling tight or dry. The reason I gave it 3 stars is because it didn't last as long as I would have hoped and the scrub was a little too aggressive for me. I don't have sensitive skin at all and it didn't cause any skin damage or anything crazy, it just felt like I was washing with sand paper. An easy solution to this is use a wash cloth which I didn't mind doing. I would like to try some of the company's soaps that aren't scrub bars for I think I would like those better.\n",

When I use the Dr. Squatch soap it left my beard smooth and lubricated.My beard normally curls up but when I use this soap it makes it straight and soft. I was amazed.

            "Meh. Liked it at first. It smells good and was fine on my skin. But... the residue got all over the shower and it broke up easily. I’m glad I just finished the bar so I can move on to something else. Not worth the price.\n",

If said items perform better then expected this may change.The amount of soap in regards to price...I spent the same amount on this order as I did Dukes Soap. I got three times as much product for the same price with Dukes. Quality so far seems the same. When I spend close to 40.00 dollars I would expect to get a generous amount of product, especially considering what this is: soap. I get that they represent the high quality end of the spectrum, but when I just compare a big ass brick of soap from Dukes to their little tile of soap I am a little disappointed.Hopefully the soap will last a while and the quality will outweigh the quantity....\n",

Out of the box, I tried to detect the fainest hint of pine but came away with only a decayed floral, bit of mint candy aroma. I chalked it up to the immense pineyness being cleverly hidden  away to be unlocked by warm H2O. It was admittedly only a hope. In the shower, the soap lathered nicely, the sharp corners digging in effectively where needed. As I scrubbed, the coarse grains became pleasingly apparent, nicely exfoliating things that enjoy exfoliation. Alas, upon full immersion and lather, the scent of this Pine Tar Soap bloomed into a sad and disappointing melange of wilted eucalyptus with undertones of plastic dime-store glasses case dusted with off-brand baby powder. Notes of hand sanitizer and shards of discarded butterscotch hard candy rounded out the experience. I had hoped for better things, believed the hype and fell for the packaging. Lesson learned, being stuck with a bathroom that now smells like Granny's sitting room complete with a bowl of those chalky mints and a dried flower array from 1977.\n",

First off before i go on babbling about my experience with the three soaps i purchased.  If you are already a manly MAN why would you need this product to unleash your inner man.  Has your manliness been put up in your womans purse or panty drawer.Any way i wasn't impressed by the scents except perhaps the cedar citrus. It reminds me of when i vacation in the mountains in a cabin.  I had been using DUKE CANNON products prior to purchasing these products.  Now those are manly size soaps and manly scents. Especially there Milwaukee Beer soap.I did notice that the Dr Squatch soaps do leave your skin with the feeling of natural oils on your skin.  I honestly don't think i will buy there soaps again.  The bars are small and i have yet to find a scent i like from Dr Squatch #bullittmendoza #infedil #countryboy #texan\n",

He is the type of person that likes to go cheap on the daily essentials such as soap, tooth paste, etc. I got him two bars: Pine Tar (exfoliating bar) and Nautical sage (regular smooth bar). He has been extremely hooked on these soaps and comments almost every day on how much he loves them. Also, he is more motivated to wake up earlier before work to enjoy a shower. Because of this, he now has a monthly subscription with Dr. Squatch where he receives two soaps a month.  I would also highly recommend to anyone who has sensitive skin. My boyfriend has extremely sensitive skin and struggles through the winter given how dry it gets. These soaps do not cause any irritation and definitely help sooth his skin. I would estimate that one bar lasts just over two weeks. I recommend removing the bar out of the shower to dry out once you're done so that will last a little longer. Overall, it seems to be a great product and also makes your bathroom smell extremely fresh!\n",
