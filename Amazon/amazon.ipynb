            "So I've been using bio oil for about a month now and It seems to be working. My newest scars have definitely been improving but my old scars still seem to be pretty dark. My face does feel alot smoother and more moisturized. It hasn't been irritating my skin and it's a great moisturizer. I use a very little bit just to get a thin layer over my face then I apply my lotion on top. I've also been using African black soap and witch hazel so the combination of these things may have resulted in this outcome but overall I'd say it's a pretty good product as adding it to my routine has seemed to help.\n",
            "This is definitely NOT the actual Bio-Oil brand. Consistency and scent is very different.\n",
            "This was definitely not like the first bottle I bought. It's maybe lasted 2 months compared to the bottle I got prior that last 6 months. The labeling is different and the consistency is diff. Will not buy again\n",
            "I have used bio oil for years. Love it, when its not counterfeit of course. This time I ordered it thru Amazon. The box was ripped and it appeared to be used, as there was no seal on the bottle. The consistency is watery and the color is a salmon pink instead of a more translucent orange color like the authentic version. Buy instead from target's offical website or an authorized retailer. Shame on amazon for giving such a large platform to counterfeit goods!\n",

A doctor recommended this to one of my friends who told me about it.  I have bought several bottles as gifts..  Be patient.  It will take a few months for you to see notice the changes.Now I am using it on my arms and hands. I hope have the same result.  I am 71 years old.  No one paid me to write this.\n",
            "A must buy!! I use this in combination with my African black soap. Has cleared up dark spots on my face\n",
            "I'm 31, and I've noticed within the last year (with the help of a careless lifestyle) my skin hasn't been bouncing back as well. I have little sections of orange peel textured skin an inch below my eyes, and across the center of my forehead. Not sure if you'd attribute that to acne in the past, or what.. but this Oil was worth a shot to \"repair the scars\". Now, as you know.. skin care is a risky game. We all have different skin types, as well as different skin issues. I'm not able to tell you what this will and won't do for you of course, but I know for me it provides glow and seems to be working quite well. It's super greasy, so I wear it at night and sleep on my back. Give it a try.\n",
            "Counterfeit!!!!! I read reviews only after purchasing which said a ton of the ones received were not the real bio oil. I kept this in mind when my package arrived. Immediately, noticed how STRONG it smelt. It reminded me of this fake rose hip oil that I previously bought from Walmart (which I also threw away as a result). This product was so terrible - It smelt like chemicals and plastic. A huge concern was that there was no seal, which was already a huge red flag - especially since many bio oil packages (depending on the OZ) have them very clearly. I did not put it on my skin.  I went to ulta & found the real thing. I am going to post below the two packages with the seals and markings so whoever might see this and buy it can see for themselves. According to youtube reviews, there is also supposed to be a scratch code for authenticity purposes that bio oil puts on their packages (? Again, saw this on a youtube review, but I didn’t open the ones at Ulta to find out). Mine did not have a seal or a scratch code to make sure it was the real thing. Very sad and hope other people contemplating buying this see this review and just go to ulta and pick it up\n",

I've had some weight gain and loss since childhood and it had left me with stretch marks that crippled my self esteem. I used this product infrequently a few years ago but noticed small results. I bought it again and have used the product twice daily for about 6 months. The discoloring on my stretch mark scarring has changed and now looks a lot more unnoticeable. I will definitely use this further in hopes time and effort will completely heal over the marks. I highly recommend it for anyone suffering from scars that they feel will never be gone. There's hope.\n",
            "I have eczema & I'm constantly trying to find basic skincare than I can use regularly. I have some really bad mosquito bite scars from last summer & some issues with hyperpigmentation, not to mention scarring from eczema outbreaks throughout the years. I saw this reviewed online & decided to give it a try, even though every other product they recommended for skincare was a bust for me.Not this! It smelled like it was going to be too strong & the consistency felt like it was just going to sit on my skin, so I was shocked when my skin drank it in & I had no irritation at all. Even better, after about two months I started noticing some fading & my skin texture felt better.Now it's been about four months & I'm a believer. I'm still on my first bottle (it seems like I've needed to use less over time or something), but I'm considering sizing up with my next purchase, just so I can drench myself in it daily...& I'm only kind of exaggerating. It's actually gentle enough for my face & I can't even use Cetaphil on my face (I use very gentle face wash & moisturizer).I recommend getting the smallest size if your skin is very sensitive, as it's not cheap, & I hope it becomes your new go-to skin treatment too!\n",
            "I've used this stuff for a few years, and I have to tell you it's pretty much replaced lotion for me. I don't put it on thick though. It makes my legs and feet silky smooth. Even putting it on the bottoms of my feet, they don't get greasy or slippery. I put it a dab on my lips to avoid chapping and lines. I dab some on the outside of my eyes to counter the crow's feet that are trying to form. Dry ankles, knees, knuckles, or elbows? Saturate them. Chapped nipples from running in the cold (or whatever you're doing to make them chapped)? Dab some on. I've used it on my face as a moisturizer in a pinch.I can't really speak to how it helps with scarring and stretch marks, but I would definitely recommend this product for basically full-body use.\n",
            "I used this for 3 days and by the 4th day, I was floored.  I noticed my skin had a \"tighter\" look and even younger.  I wasn't expecting results like that.  I also noticed that 2 freckles that have become blotches with age, are almost completely faded.  That was definitely unexpected.  My boyfriend actually commented on my face looking tighter and he had no idea I was using any new products, nor had I asked him if he noticed my face looking any different.  He is now ordering Bio Oil.  I am floored by this product and I am a huge skeptic on ny beauty care items being miracle makeovers.  This is pretty darn close!\n",
            "I used this twice daily starting in the second trimester and am happy to report NO STRETCHMARKS now after pregnancy! This is really saying something as I have been prone to strethmarks my entire life, as have my mom and sister: I got them bad in the teenage years. I used this product on my tummy, hips, and thighs along with a natural lotion (shea, coconut) to moisturize and have no new stretchmarks at all. I should add that I am 30yo, and have skin that easily bruises or injures. NOTHING! I would highly recommend this and intend to use it for future pregnancies.I also used it to prevent scarring. I passed out in the first trimester and cut my forehead; a legit Harry Potter cut. It really helped to fade the cut and subsequent scar.\n",
            "Upon the recommendation of a friend, I began using a different stretch mark product around 2 months before my daughter was born. This was long before I had stretch marks appear, but surprise! They popped up anyway. Totally expected this to happen- but this product claimed to prevent stretch marks so I was a bit disheartened. I continued using this product until my daughter was approximately 5-6 months old on the advice that I give it time, but saw no improvement whatsoever.To the important part of my review: I began using Bio-Oil upon the recommendation of the all-knowing Google and have been for around 7 months (my daughter just turned 13 months one week ago). It is INCREDIBLE. I cannot over-hype this product. Let me detail why:1. I have extraordinarily sensitive skin (I can't use Aloe or any lotion/wash with fragrance- my skin is that sensitive) and I am able to use Bio-Oil all over my stomach and legs with absolutely no negative reaction. I have not used it elsewhere so I am unsure what, if any, sensitivities could arise.2. I am paler than the palest-pale person. The stretch marks on my stomach and legs were a deep-purple tone and highly visible. I assumed that no matter how wonderful the product, they would never truly \"disappear\" given the contrasting colors.These two factors made me really concerned about the ability to combat stretch marks without some sort of professional intervention- such as dermatological work. I'm a full-time student in law school and my budget is very restrictive so I was motivated to explore more affordable options.*THE RESULTS*After 2 months of daily use, I began to notice significant improvement in both the visibility and the texture of my stretch marks. The deep-purple tone was much, much lighter. I would say that the results at this point were 10 times greater than any improvement I saw with the last product I tried.After 4-5 months of daily use, the stretch marks on my stomach were nearly the same tone as my skin. The were significantly less \"rough\" than before as well. The results at this point exceeded my greatest expectations.Today the stretch marks on my stomach are gone. GONE. I know that this product is not guaranteed to completely eliminate stretch marks, but it has with mine. The stretch marks on my legs are still visible, but they are much, much lighter. I faithfully use Bio-Oil on my stomach every morning after I take a shower- I imagine that twice-daily use would result in the reduction of stretch mark visibility even faster, but cannot say with certainty. I have not been as vigilant in the application of Bio-Oil to my legs and that is likely the reason why the results are less remarkable. I have no doubt that the more faithful application could result in the same improvement I've seen on my stomach and I will update this review accordingly.I continue to use Bio-Oil daily because it makes my skin silky-smooth and I hope it will reduce the appearance of stretch marks in the future.*OVERALL*I would recommend this product to everyone. Unless you have a specific allergy to the ingredients in Bio-Oil, give it a chance. Use it daily. Give it a couple of months- I have yet to find a more affordable option that offers results \"instantly.\" I am awed by the results I've experienced thus far.Here's a quick summary of this long review: I am 25 years old and White. I have highly sensitive skin. I love this product. My stretch marks are either invisible or faded significantly after 7 months of daily use.\n",
            "The Smell is hard to describe,... my first reaction was \"Ewww ,this is what everyone is raving about ,im just not seeing iti\" It has a weird , disturbing ,very synthetic  wanna be  cinnamon ( but not in a good way ,if that makes sense) top note  ...followed by an old  musty  stale arcid ending .After reading the other reviews i cannot believe  i missed the tons of bad reviews ,which  confirm what i suspected .This  is a complete and utter fake.My legs itched and it made no difference on my skin.This seller should not be allowed to sell a fake product here.Please save your money and buy from an authorized seller .\n",
            "I use this for 1 month and it getting better.\n",
            "I have now used Bio-Oil through 3 pregnancies (all within 4 years) and would not hesitate to recommend it.  I believe I am prone to stretch marks as I have them on my thighs from my teen years.  In addition, my mother and grandmother both have many marks from their pregnancies.  I started using Bio-Oil as soon as I found out I was pregnant (between 4-8 weeks) with all of my pregnancies.  I typically use it 2x per day (morning + night) all over my belly, lower back, hips, and thighs.  I went through 3-4 full-size bottles throughout each pregnancy.It absorbs well - I've never had an issue with it getting on clothes, bed sheets, etc. and the smell/aroma is minimal.  I'm fairly sensitive to smells, especially during pregnancy, but I never had an issue with this oil.For full disclosure, I gained between 20-30 lbs each pregnancy, my babies were on the smaller side, and I delivered between 3-6 weeks early with each.  So, take my review for what it is.  That being said, I do feel that the stretch marks on my thighs improved.  They were quite old (about 8-10 years+) and had already faded to white, but they are always much less noticeable after using Bio-Oil.  I'm not sure if this is solely due to just being better hydrated OR if the Bio-Oil really had an impact on old scars.\n",
            "I put this on at least 1-2 times daily since I received this 2 weeks ago. I use it on my belly where I have stretch marks from my pregnancy and I also use it on my face and it helps moisturize my dry skin. I can tell my face is clearing up from my months-long acne breakout AND I use the oil on my underarms after I get out of the shower to try and lighten them up. Since my pregnancy, my underarms had gotten kind of dark and I'm embarrassed to even raise them if I have a tank top on... It looks to be helping my discoloration on both my face (from my acne) and underarms and I feel like my stretch marks look different as well. Very impressed with this product. I will continue to use and hope to see even better results!\n"

            "This is the second time I’ve purchased Bio oil. I bought the small bottle the first time because I’m always sceptical of products with big claims. I am pleasantly surprised to find bio oil works very well on my skin. I mix it with my moisturizer products for my face. In a few days the Brown age spots began to fade. I wanted to make sure so I put just bio oil on brown spots on my arm. It worked!! I highly recommend this product.\n",
            "I really like this stuff. I'm not sure how well it works on past stretch marks, but it works wonders on scars. I got bit by a dog last summer and nothing was working to get rid of the scar. I also had a scar from a scratch on my knee, as well as chicken pock scars, and scars from a wrist surgery. This oil seems to be fading them all!I put it on once a day after the shower (if that), and I've noticed the progress, even without photos. I also think that it helps to spread/lengthen the life of other lotions as well (given that it is an oil, if you put lotion on your legs, less will go longer than without the oil), so it helps you save money in the lotion department.First pictures are when I first got bit, second is when I was trying products to fade the mark, and last is now.\n",
            "I especially love how this stuff doesn't stain my clothes after I put it on. It soaks into my skin fast and has a pleasant smell. I use this for my pregnancy in which I am now on my last month of. All the women in my family have stretch marks, but I do not. I contribute this a lot to not only healthy eating habits but this oil as well. Of course I use different lotions with it (Burt's Bees and Body Merry) but I like to apply this after I get out of the shower for quick absorbing. Not only that but I am super happy it is cruelty free. Major plus if you ask me.\n",
            "Best thing in the world. Saved my life. Love, love ❤️\n",
            "This 6.7oz oil arrived the other day and I was so excited!  I ordered it for my daughter for a few acne blemishes on her face and spots from ingrown hair at her bikini line.  I figured this would be an excellent oil to apply after using the Dark Spot Corrector Peel (face) and Evagloss Bumps Solution (lady parts) for a 30-day regime she's starting today. But I became agitated to find the manufacturer INTENTIONALLY listed (the Product's Description - \"Important Information\" section) Ingredients in SPORADIC ORDER. As a former cosmetologist, I'm certain this was done to deceive unsuspecting people about products and processed foods.For those that don't know, please note: \"The FIRST 3 Ingredients in ANY PRODUCT are the BASE/MAIN ingredients\".  Example- think of a cake calling for 2-Cups of Wheat Flour but 3/4 Cornstarch and 1/4 Wheat Flour is used instead.  The cake will be fine, however, substituting with 3/4 Cornstarch (or even half and half) defeats the purpose of using Wheat Flour.  The health benefits Wheat Flour has in terms of LESS carbohydrates, MORE protein, dietary fiber, vitamins and minerals became SIGNIFICANTLY DILUTED with artery clogging Cornstarch.  Same of this Bio Oil actually being \"Mineral Oil\" not \"Botanicals and Essential Oil\" BASED per the ORDER OF INGREDIENTS printed on the Product Label.  My issue is that some manufacturers obscure whether their Mineral Oil/Petroleum based product is highly REFINED or simply \"Treated\".  Although the FDA allows \"Mineral Oil (Paraffinum Liquidum)\" to be listed, they're NOT the same.  \"Treated\" (low grade) Mineral Oil doesn't necessarily mean all carcinogenic (cancer causing) or other toxins have been removed.  Highly REFINED Mineral Oil i.e., Paraffinum Liquidum is non-toxic/Food Grade thus safe.Most good products have good ingredients listed as the first. A product's components are listed by quantity highest to lowest and the first ingredients should correspond with the product states to be.  Mild to moderate chemical components (additives if any) should follow the 4th ingredient and so on which represents a products Base to Transition- even food.  It's like buying \"Shea Butter Body Wash\" yet Shea Butter is the 14th of 20 ingredients.  This suggests a ratio of at most \"5% Shea Butter\" to \"95% Other\" ingredients meaning it’s NOT a \"Shea Butter” body wash\".I'm not saying Bio Oil is bad, I've used Mineral Oil based products in the past and can't say they're all bad.  Through my dad (biology and chemistry major/global company chemical plant manager), I learned much more about components, interaction, and reaction, etc., beyond just a Cosmetology standpoint.  As I now suffer multiple autoimmune disorders, the onset was said to have been \"environmentally triggered\" meaning \"external source or product\".  It makes one wonder what could've contributed to, if not caused these ailments since I relocated 10+years ago.  I now carefully read labels (beyond the first 3 ingredients) and question some products that lack USDA, FDA and/or CGMP Approval.I was certain the first 6 ingredients of this oil stated nothing of Mineral Oil. In that, the label listing Mineral Oil defeats my efforts to ignore the reviews claiming \"fake Bio Oil\".  There's a reason the order i.e., quantity of ingredients are required and must be listed correctly on Product Labels.  Certain products may give the desired outcome in the short-term but the long-term effects of their ingredients can change and/or cause you to lose your life.Having 4.5 of 5-star ratings from 74K+ customers intertwined with very old (almost 10yr ago) reviews seems this oil is a good thing of the past.  At the end of the day, always remember \"First 3 is 4 Me\" to weigh quantity for quality in products.  \"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure\" so make sure you received what you bought not what you were deceived into buying.  With all that said, I just returned mine as the label spoke volumes of deception as seen and explained here.  Be blessed and stay safe!\n",
            "This product has changed my skin forever. I’ve been using it for a year and a half and my skin is better than ever. I mix mine with tea tree oil to treat my acne. It’s light, it smells great, and it treats existing skin damage. If you have sun damage, small wrinkles, discoloration, or acne scars you should give this six months and see if it works for you.\n",
            "I LOVE my Bio-Oil! I shower at the end of every day and right when I get out, I lather up my whole body with the oil, from my neck, to my arms, chest, stomach, sides and legs. I especially focus on rubbing in the oil on my sides and front and back of my thighs. The oil has helped to diminish my stretch marks on my sides, as well as cellulite on my thighs. Not to mention how soft my skin is! No joke. My skin has never been softer from a product. I have this healthy glow look to my skin that I’ve never had before. I ran out of this oil for about a month, and my skin stayed just as soft and radiant, I didn’t even use any other type of moisturizer for the time being. So this product sure works like gold. Only downside- the bottle isn’t big enough!! I go through this product way too fast for how small the bottle is. It is an oil, so it does make your skin feel oily, but it absorbs fairly fast!\n",
            "I did a lot of research before purchasing Bio Oil, as I've bought well reviewed products on Amazon in the past and not had any luck with them. After reading countless articles and glowing reviews, I finally bought a bottle and have been using it for the past week at night on my face. I go through my usual skincare routine and then apply a drop or two after my night time moisturizer.Let me tell you, I could not be happier! This past winter, my usual healthy skin has become incredibly dry and flaky and nothing has helped. After only a week, my face already feels and looks so much softer and even toned.The product is definitely greasy and takes time to absorb, but after fifteen minutes my skin is literally glowing and dewy. The only reason I havent been using it in the morning is because I'm worried how it might look under makeup. Overall, I would absolutely recommend this product to everyone I know :)\n",
            "Don't use it on your face especially if you're acne prone. Bought it to treat acne scars and it ended up breaking me out horribly and just making the situation worse. I looked it up on cosdna.com per my dermatologists reccommendation and it has ingredients in it that are acne causing as well as irritating. It would maybe be fine on the rest of your body but I don't really need it. Going to give it to someone.\n",
            "I don't wanna jinx myself, but I am 8 months pregnant and have used this religiously a minimum of twice a day since my first trimester--which, honestly, has resulted in me spending quite a bit, because I have reordered the largest size probably at least 4 times-so it hasn't been cheap. I haven't had one stretch mark, nor do I experience itchiness. My skin is always super supple. And after I smear my belly, boobs, and booty, I also make sure to do a one over and cover my face with it.I mix bio-oil with organic jojoba oil (which is supposed to be excellent for absorption) and castor oil (great for blood circulation and a variety of different things).

            "I’ve been using bio oil for years, mostly on my face. I used to have scars along my chin where I had a ton of breakouts, but they’re all but gone now! I have a different skin regime for my face now, so I use it mostly on my body due to pregnancy. It keeps my skin supple and I have not noticed any additional stretch marks. If you’re wanting to use this to get rid of scars, remember it’s a process and will take months, but it definitely pays off!\n",
            "This stuff is awesome! I purchased this product after my two year old was scratched on the cheek by a cat. My daughter ended up with a two inch scar down her cheek and I wanted to try this in hopes of getting the scar to at least be less visible. I rubbed a small amount of Bio Oil on my daughters cheek twice a day and within just a couple of weeks the scar had completely disappeared. I am thankful Bio Oil worked so well and my daughter was not left with a large scar down her cheek forever.\n",
            "I'm the most skeptical person I know but I had heard great things about bio oil so I bought it. I have been using on one arm for about 3 weeks and even after week 1 the difference was so noticeable I decided to use on the other arm as well. My age spots have gone from embarrassingly noticeable to almost non existent. I could not be more thrilled. Telling everyone woman I know about bio oil. I am 100% on board with the greatness of this product.\n",
            "Wifey: I love this oil!!! I got this oil when I was pregnant and smeared it all over my belly. Roughly three times a day. After having my baby I got Zero stretch marks. Now, I can not give full credit to this oil but it has a huge role in it, I think. I had stretch marks before my pregnancy, so I was adamant to do whatever I can to hopefully prevent it from developing on my belly. I highly recommend this product. Note- I did not notice that it reduced stretch marks appearance that are already there.\n",
            "This is probably my 12ty bottle. I used to buy at Walgreens for double the price! I’m glad amazon sells them. I use this for my stretch marks from being pregnant. Also on my heels to prevents ugly dry cracked heels. I love how subtle the smell is. Oh and I’ve also used it when i was pregnant. I slathered them food on my belly and I guess that’s why I only have super small and faint stretch marks because of it.\n",
            "I used this religiously while pregnant and I loved it! The scent is really nice, although some people might not like it as much as others because it does have a very strong essential oil scent. I originally bought this to help prevent stretch marks. I ended up getting a few on my hips and butt. However, I think this definitely helped keep my skin nourished and healthy all throughout my pregnancy. It is hard to tell how effective it was at preventing more stretch marks from forming since I don't know how many I would have gotten without it. But the product made my skin feel so healthy and soft. I highly recommend for any pregnant women out there or anyone looking for a nice nourishing product! It definitely is an oil so you don't need a lot of it. It spreads around really easily. I do warn that it will create oil stains on certain clothing. I would always put it on before going to bed and it created an oil stain across the belly of my gray night shirt. I'm not too upset about it since it's just a simple t-shirt that I only wear to bed, but if you are potentially going to use it before putting on a nice shirt, I would warn against it, just in case.\n",
            "Best advice was from a dermatological nurse I happened to meet at my surgeon's office.  Her daughter had just had surgery also.  Her advice:  Use BioOil daily on surgical scar once wound is healed, rub in the direction of the scar (not across it), and do not expose the scar to sunlight - for at least 6 months.  This advice was very helpful.  I now also use BioOil on my skin after showering.  It is wonderful.\n",
            "When I first used this I was appalled that it was mineral oil, which I never use. And in research found that Purcellin is a made up name for who knows what, but after using it, I can say that my dark spots are fading and I've been using it for only a matter of weeks. My skin looks better and feels soft and healthy. Who knew? Anyway, I'm a believer and have recommended it to friends.\n",
            "This stuff is awesome. I get dry patches on my face in the winter and since using this, no more dry patches! I have pretty sensitive skin and I can't use most creamy moisturizers because I'll break out, Bio-Oil adds the moisture I need without breaking me out. It also helps to reduce old acne scars and evens out my skin tone. As an added benefit, the smell is light and clean!\n",
            "I really don't enjoy doing the work to take care of my skin. When I do, I don't always enjoy the feeling of the product... and I've tried a lot since my mom keeps getting me different ones to try... both Asian and American products.This is the only one thing I actually enjoy using. My skin definitely is doing better. The scars are fading, my face is moisturized for a long time. AND it doesn't feel excessicely oily. Your skin absorbs the oil fast and it just feel more moist and smooth.\n",

            "So I was a little skeptical about purchasing after seeing reviews but decided to give it a try. Obviously, you can tell it was a success!! I ordered the 4oz and received just that. The box is the most updated version which is a plus (checked other retailers aka Target). After giving birth I had numerous issues this has helped me with including discoloration, stretch marks (new and old) plus my surgical scar. Well, FOR ME ( everyone’s body is different) within the 1st wk the discoloration started clearing up and I have also noticed my scar was looking so much better!!! still working on the stretch marks 2 times a day faithfully!!\n",
            "I’ve tried a lot of products to remove blemishes on my back. It’s the only place I have scarring, etc from acne (bacne) and a bad spout with picking from particular extracurriculars. With that said-and well into recovery-this stuff seems to be working. I pair it with aloe Vera gel and coconut oil. I think between that combo, it’s finally beginning to clear! I say give it a try! And leave us all a review in a month or so of use.\n",
            "My skin suddenly became uncomfortably dry when the temps dropped which was unusual bc up until now I had oily combination skin.  I tried a ton of moisturizers - best rated drugstore brands to well rated products by Sephora and Korean skincare that promised to fix my dry winter skin.  Then I found a bottle of bio oil I had purchased back in 2015 in the back of my makeup drawer.  After two weeks of dedicated use, both at night and in the AM and I can say that this stuff works! No more dry areas around my eyes and nose when the temps drops. After two weeks, I didn’t have any negative reactions either.  I’ve been recommending it to friends and they are all amazed.  Smooth, moisturized skin so far this winter.  I’m a devotee.\n",
            "This oil is MAGICAL!!! Over the years I've earned my stripes (and stretch marks and scars) and while not entirely making them gone, it does aid in lessening them, even the old ones! I recently had surgery and as soon as the bandages came off and I was allowed to put anything on it, I started using this. At first I mixed it with the Neosporin I used and covered with a bandage to keep it in contact with my skin as long as possible. I now use it combined with Vaseline with a non stick pad and use those latexish type restickable wraps. It's still fresh, but is lying down smoothly and is keeping my skin soft and supple. If pregnant, I believe starting at the first of your last triimester will help with the stretch marks.  Get you some of this stuff and get to it!\n",
            "I'm 27 and still struggling with acne and the scarring that comes with it. After one use of this over night I was pretty shocked the next day, my skin texture and acne itself looked noticeably better. It's now been only three days since I've been using this before bed time and I'm just amazed how clear, how soft, and how it's less oily my skin is throughout the day. Only slightly negative thing is I'm just not crazy about the smell, reminds me of an older ladies perfume because of the rose in it. Regardless this stuff is awesome and cant wait to see the out come of using it long term!\n",
            "I’ve been using this product for years on my face for left over acne scars/ skin tone. When I got pregnant I started using it on my chest, stomach, thighs, and bum area. Basically all the areas that can potentially swell when you are making a baby! Now I continue to use it on my stomach and c-section scar. Has worked great for sun burns/damage too.\n",
            "I wasn't sure about buying this at first, but took the risk based off of all the good results I've read about. I tend to be heavy handed with products and thankfully after a month of using this, the bottle is still basically full. I have normal type skin, but wanted to use this for my uneven skin tones and skin tags. After a month of using it, my skin looks a lot more even! It looks more youthful and has really helped with the bags under my eyes. Didn't really help with my skin tags, but overall I really like it and have noticed a difference in my skin.\n",
            "My arm was burned the skin was pink in some places and black in others. It has returned my skin almost to its normal dark pigment in just 6weeks of using.  I also use it on my face and it has started to lift my dark age spots. I am African American with a dark complexion.  My Bi-racial daughter in law recommended it to me.\n",
            "I love this stuff for my 5 year old daughter, she has a bad habit of scratching until she gets a scab then scratching the scab off which  creates ugly scars. Rubbing this on her legs daily has cleared her existing scars and helped hear scabs before she can pick them off.\n",
            "Used daily after the shower to prevent stretch marks during my pregnancy. Both my mother and sister have terrible stretch marks as a result of their pregnancies. After using this product I am so glad to say I don’t have a single stretch mark. I ended up having an emergency c-section at 38 weeks due to Hurricane Michael. I’ve used this product on my c-section scar and, after 3 weeks, can hardly see the incision line. I’m so glad I used this product and would definitely recommend!!\n"

I recently bought my second bottle. I love this stuff!\n",

Was so afraid my scar would stretch with my growing abdomen. No joke, after 5 months of twice a day application, it’s GONE! I can’t even see where it was! I will definitely be recommending this over any other otc scarring product.\n",
            "I was skeptical of how amazing the reviews are, but this stuff is pure gold. I use it on stretch marks on my legs-and in just a week they went from bright angry red to purple. I use it twice a day if I remember, and its amazing. I also rub it on my face after I wash my face, and rub it in super well-it has made my acne on my cheeks go WAY down, and is removing the scars. I have amazing skin now-I use this stuff EVERY day, and I've barely even put a dent in it. This size is amazing, and for the price-holy cow. I seriously never leave reviews, but seriously this stuff is pure magic. I tried vitamin C serum, rosehip, witch hazel, etc. and this is the only thing that has worked for me. Good luck!!\n",

I have used it once or twice a day daily and am currently 28 weeks pregnant and do not have any stretch marks. I’ve also gained about 30 pounds and it’s all in my belly so I’m huge. Even though stretch marks are genetic, I have stretch marks all over my inner And outer thighs as well as up the sides of my hips from being overweight in junior high. So I’m prone to getting stretch marks but haven’t received any from this pregnancy, kind of a sweet deal!\n",
            "We spend a lot of hours outside in the sun for my kids' sports, especially in the summer for travel baseball.  I noticed after this season my arms were developing several \"sun spots\".  I started using this oil and noticed a difference in less than two weeks.  Then within a couple more weeks, I noticed my hands were looking a lot younger and smoother.  I really love this oil and it's a part of my daily regimen for skin care.  It has made a significantly, noticeable difference and I am very pleased with the results.\n",
            "A little goes a long way!!! I love bio oil. I have been using it for 2-3 weeks now and I have already seen a lot of improvement in my skin. I have very fair skin and it scars very easily, and I used to have so many dark spots around my mouth. This product has helped so much! I use it only at night because it is too oily for my oily skin to wear during the day.\n",

            "5/24/2020 Bio-Oil diaries: the discoloration on my cheeks from a few years old acne scars is improving. My skin looks younger - it’s hard to describe.. but I can see a difference. It looks less rough. I’ve been using it morning and night. I’ll update again soon.5/19/2020 I found out about this product while scrolling through TikTok last week. It came highly recommended, so I decided to look up the price on amazon. After reading several reviews, I figured I might as well try it out. Today is the 4th day I use the product on my face. My skin looks dewy and nice. Maybe a little too oily, but hey - we're in Quarantine, so who cares?  My skin looks more even toned. So, let me give some background information on my skin that might help someone who can relate. As a teenager I had 0 acne. Very rarely would I get a period pimple. When I got into my early 20's I started taking a medication prescribed to me for PTSD. Unfortunately, acne was not listed as a side effect. I took it for one year and during that year I got cystic acne and scarring as a consequence. Just horrific, painful, depressing... and I couldn't figure out why. One day I decided to google the medication and acne side effects and to my horror, I found a bunch of info correlating the two. I stopped taking it immediately, but the damaging scars where there to stay. Through the years, I've tried several different remediations. I went to Ideal Image and had thousands of dollars worth of lasers on my face to help with scarring (they faded just slightly, but they were not gone), I've spent I don't even know how much on facials / microdermabrasion - I was going every 2 weeks because I could see a slight different with the microdermabrasion and I was on a mission to get rid of these scars before I turned 30. Welp, I'm 30 now. Have been now for 5 months - and I still have the scars. And now I'm here. With this new oil. Praying it works and writing a review. I'm going to put in the time and update this review as I go because although scars don't hurt physically, sometimes they hurt mentally. And if this product truly works and I can convince just one person to try it and lead them to success, then it is worth it. On the contrary, if it doesn't, then I can save someone the disappointment of trying yet another product and feeling let down. Right now I'm giving it 5 stars because of what I've seen and felt so far. Lets cross our fingers and see what the future holds.\n",
            "I have used this throughout my pregnancy. I apply It after I’m done with my shower and then I do a little rinse and pat dry with a towel. I feel like this product has kept my skin less itchy and irritated throughout the winter, and it has helped with the rough bumps I get From dry skin.\n",
            "I mixed the oil with Whole Foods lotion and it helps my skin stay soft and smell nice. The scent is so calming. It helps falling asleep easily. I almost finish my 2nd bottom.\n",
            "This was recommended to me by a friend to use during pregnancy. It never irritated my skin, and I'm now in my 9th month without any stretch marks or significant changes to my skin (and my belly has expanded a lot). Obviously our genes (and some luck) play into this sort of thing, but all I know is that I used this every morning starting around month 3 (along with lotion in the evening) and felt it was a great way to moisturize. One bottle lasts a long time, and there is no lingering smell on your skin.\n",
            "I bought this to use it during my pregnancy to help prevent/minimize stretch marks. I can’t speak on the effectiveness of that but I started getting this tingly/itchy sensation on my belly after I started using it. No rashes or redness but just more itchy feeling. The oil is non-greasy and generally feels good but I didn’t like the itchy feeling urging me to scratch my belly. After using it for a month and half, I stopped using this oil and just used my regular Aveeno body moisturizer, and I didn’t get that urge to scratch my belly- no itchiness. So, now I am hesitant on using it. Also, the contradicting information on this oil’s safety during pregnancy doesn’t help. I am looking to try a different product now.\n"

Wrong. Here is a list of the ingredients.

            "The smell of this is amazing - however it does not work so well for stretch marks. Also, I noticed that this is NOT mostly natural as mineral oil is first on the list of ingredients.I would definitely buy again because it blends into your skin quickly and won’t leave residue stains on your clothing, and it makes your skin feel so nice once it’s been absorbed.\n",
            "obsessed!  yes, it is as good as they say it is.  :)  in my 3rd trimester, measuring slightly above average, and still no stretch marks!  dries quick too so when you're in a hurry, zero concern for oil to get on clothes.  feels light, skin looks great.  preggers suggestions: breasts, belly, love handles, inner and outer thighs.  i use a shea lotion for the rest of my body to ration this product, so focus the good stuff on the most susceptible areas.\n",

For the price I said it’s worth a try. LET ME TELL YOU... this stuff did wonders for me. It faded out my stretch marks with in 4-6 weeks. Plus it smells great!\n",
            "Love love love!! Smells great and keeps you moisturized all day! Stop your skin from itching and all around great product. I have been using it my entire pregnancy. Once in the morning and again before bed. I’ve noticed that when I don’t use it, that’s when I feel my skin get a little itchy but once I put a little on, dry skin is gone. Absorbs really well too so it’s not messy on your clothes. You can get dressed right after applying. Best skin oil ever! I will use this even after baby.\n",
            "At first I was skeptical after reading the reviews but for the price I decided to try it. It smells really nice and you don't need much, and I have seen some results and I don't use it as much as I should because I always forget. I even use it on my face where proactive has failed.  I suffer from chronic pain and am unable to exercise so I even ordered one of those little massage cups to use with it.\n",
            "Opened package and it was open on the bottom. The box was ripped slightly! And part of the words on the bottle are scratched off. Also seems very liquid like water more then oil. I’m just not sure if this was used or fake! Very disappointed. Read reviews but bought it anyway because soooo many people reviewed. I feel compelled to go by from CVS down my street to compare to see if it’s real or fake. Packing is the biggest tip off it may be fake or was previously used. Scent is still nice but has a perfume quality vs oil quality. I’m not scared to try it but I wonder if it will have the right effects and maybe just return it? Boo. What a let down!\n",
            "Gonna start by saying I have very sensitive and blemish/discoloration prone skin. I have stretch marks on the inside of my thighs from gaining about 10lbs recovering from an eating disorder as a teen. I suffered from cystic acne from 20-22 and occasionally now (23). So when I learned I was pregnant, I knew my belly was going to be wrecked with stretch marks. As long as your baby is healthy it's worth it, but who doesn't want to avoid them? So I got online and researched and like lots of things when your pregnant, I forgot about it. Around 5 months when I finally started to show, I said screw it and bought a bottle of BioOil at the grocery. I kept telling myself \"I'll get one of those expensive special belly lotions/oils if this starts to not work\" but it just kept working! Here I am at 37 weeks, I've gone through about 24oz of BioOil and nothing else, and I am yet to have one stretch mark! Time will tell and I'll update this after my little boy gets here, but if anyone is looking for something easy to use that helps prevent stretch marks, try this first!  The texture is great, it soaks into your skin instead of just sitting on top and it really works! (PS I also use it on my breasts, so far it has helped prevent sagging and marks there too, even through the crazy growth) I really hope I didn't jinx myself but I just had to share with anyone else out there looking for a low maintenance way to avoid stretch marks. Twice a day, takes 2 minutes, and it works! I'll be using this postpartum and into the future as I age.Just to show how much my skin stretched I included a picture from before I was pregnant. Can't believe they were taken only a year apart! :(\n",
            "First time using bio oil. Bought the biggest bottle, as I’m planning to use it throughout my pregnancy.Seal or no seal: there is NO seal. There are so many conflicting info in the reviews and the Q&As. So I actually went to the local drug store and got one to compare. Same thing, no seal. The one I got from the store is the smallest size.Maybe years ago it came with a seal? I don’t know. All I know is that the current version doesn’t. So please stop calling it a fake because of that.Pros:I developed dry/red/flaky skin around my mouth since pregnancy. I tried lotions, serums and oil based essence but none of them last more than a couple of hours before the skin becomes dry and flaky again. I tried this bio oil around my mouth, it actually would keep the area moisturized very long. I do wash my mouth after meals and re-apply, so I don’t know whether it’d last a whole day, but it has been dramatically longer lasting than my other products. The redness is also reducing overtime. Not completely gone yet, but previous the redness was surrounding my mouth area, now it’s only at the corner of the mouth and above, nothing on the chin any more.My husband is also using it on his knuckles on one hand that’s itchy. It seems to be helpful for his skin condition too. We don’t know exactly what that is, the doctor just asked him to put anti-itchy cream which isn’t very helpful. This oil does help so he’s been using it.Cons:Gosh for me, it has to be the smell. I honestly thought it was a fake product when I first tried it because I really don’t like the smell! Some reviewers said they love the smell or it comes with a pleasant smell, no it doesn’t! That’s another reason for me to get one from the drug store to compare. It turns out that’s just how this thing smells. It has a a pretty strong oil smell that reminds me of industrial oil products. It doesn’t come with the any flowery or pleasant smell, not even like the basic no-smell oils, but actually something I dislike. So be forewarned. If you put a little on your palm, the smell isn’t strong, but if you rub it in, like on your tummy or on your face, holding your breath for a few seconds won’t do it. Since I do use it around my mouth, I even tried to mix it with my other non oil based serums to cover its smell a little, which helps but it also reduces its moisturizing effect. Since it’s the only product that works with the dry skin around my mouth, I’m biting the bullet. The smell doesn’t linger for long, so that was helpful.If you are not sure about the smell, get a small bottle to try it out. At least for me, the benefits out win the smell issue for me.Funny that I’m not mentioning any stretch mark effect as pros or cons. I actually have developed some stretch marks on my lower back and my butt cheeks before using this product since the pregnancy, not on tummy yet. I don’t expect the product to get rid of the existing stretch marks or at least not in a short period of time. Maybe in a few months it’d get better over, and more important to me is for prevention of new stretch marks.\n"

I only use it once per day but I’m sure if I did it twice per day it be even more effective! I’ve used the oil several times on my stretch marks and i’ve seen a little improvement as well.

            "I used this during my first pregnancy! I started using it in the second trimester, usually only 1x per day and then used it 2x per day during my 3rd trimester when I could remember. In the end I had gained about 35lb and had 1 small dime sized stretch mark around my hip area (where I didn’t apply Bio Oil as often/regularly. Even my OB commented on how surprised he was that I didn’t have any stretch marks! Super pleased with this purchase. Pleasant scent, rubs in easily. Will definitely use again if we are fortunate enough to have more children!!\n",

I know most stretch marks tend to be genetic. However, this is my 2nd child and I have No knew marks!! It’s also helped diminish a big scar on my knee. I’m a believer!I bought on amazon b/c it was $10 more at any store I found it at!\n",
            "I have been using this stuff every other day (alternating with coconut oil) to moisturize my skin as my belly grows. I loved the scent and the way it moisturized so much that I now use it on my entire body. I haven't gotten a lot of stretch marks, but I did eventually develop some on my hips / top of butt and under my breasts although I was using this product. I think developing some stretch marks is normal, especially with my genetics, as I am prone to getting them! I have continued to buy this product over & over throughout my pregnancy because I think it does a great job keeping my skin as elastic as possible. I would not recommend using this every day or more than once a day because I did notice that if I did this, I started to develop acne on my chest and stomach and random places on my body. I think the oil started to clog my pores. Overall, if you switch off using this with another lotion and skin product, I think it is a great addition to help with pregnancy stretch marks! Also, let's be honest, this is not the cheapest product out there, so switching off with something else will make it last a lot longer. I hope this helps!\n",
            "Idk if this works but it makes my skin feel really lux!\n",
            "Okay, this stuff is AMAZING. I’m usually very skeptical of hyperbole, so I didn’t really expect much.  Within a couple of months, it has faded the brown hormonal spots on my cheeks (don’t forget your sunscreen, ladies...) that I’ve had for years and they are almost gone. I wish I had taken a before pic so I could show how dramatic the results are, but I didn’t think it would work so I didn’t bother. But this is where it truly sold me— I had this precancerous thing right in the center of my chest. Dermatologist had to freeze it off and it looked terrible. Asked the dermatologist If it would scar and she shrugged and said, probably but Mederma *might* work...but better than cancer (again with the sunscreen). I hated it because it was high up in the center so I couldn’t wear any of my summer spots. Tried using the bio-oil—again, not expecting much—and within a month, it has faded so much that it’s barely noticeable! Can’t wait to show my dermatologist lol. Same thing for a nasty second degree burn scar that just wouldn’t go away—it is!!I wish I had known about this stuff when I was pregnant because I have no doubt that it would prevent stretch marks. It is *that* good and less than half the price of Mederma. Also feels great, not greasy at all, skin immediately absorbs it. It is my favorite product and I use it on any skin issue now. GET IT!!\n",
            "This is a MUST HAVE for expecting mamas.... I used this two-thirds times a day during my pregnancy starting at month 2 and have NO STRETCH MARKS on my tummy!!!! I gained 65 lbs this pregnancy too!! My body stretched at full capacity very quickly, yet this oil truly truly helped prevent stretch marks... highly recommend using coco butter with it!\n",
            "Love this! I’ve been using it at night to help lighten hyperpigmentation from acne, and I’ve definitely noticed my skin looks clearer and more glowy. I have sensitive skin, so I do have to watch this around my eyes as it irritates the delicate skin there, but This doesn’t seem to break me out at all, and it’s such a great value.I apply this at night to freshly cleansed skin then follow with a thing layer of moisturizer to “lock it in” but you could probably skip the moisturizer, as this is an oil. Definitely don’t apply during the day though. It’s too heavy:l/ greasy for daytime use and even a little bit will make your makeup slip and melt within a few hours.\n",
            "As a mom of four who has used this religiously in every one of her pregnancies I can say that it’s the best I’ve found as far as moisturizing goes. I love that it doesn’t stain and the scent is nice.  With that said though, it’s not a miracle for stretch marks! I don’t think there is such a thing out there that is, but it sure would be nice if there was!! Regardless, it’s definitely my go to, it helps relieve my dry itchy belly as it grows! ❤️\n"

I've already placed another order for 2 more large bottles!\n",
            "I used this product since beginning of 2nd trimester. Daily use apply on my tummy after shower. So far I don’t have any stretch mark. And I brought another bottle. The only thing I don’t like it very much is the perfume seems a bit too strong for pregnant women.\n",
            "I recently had a surgical procedure that left me with a fairly serious looking scar on my neck. Unfortunately due to its location it’s highly visible. I believe the surgeon did his best to minimize the visual effect but it is still out there none the less. This seems to really make a difference in hiding/reducing the appearance of the scar. It’s been about 3 months and the difference has been incredible. The scent is light and pleasant and does not overwhelm your senses.\n",
            "Used this in combination with skinception because bio-oil is much more affordable, alternating between products (one in the morning and one in the evening) and it has drastically improved my stretch marks. It's been several months, they haven't disappeared completely but they aren't as visible.\n",
            "I don't know why they advertise this product to pregnant women. It contains retinyl palmitate which could be harmful to the unborn baby. Please do some research before purchasing this item if you are pregnant!!!! I obviously tried to return the item since it contains this ingredient but they won't give me back the entire amount.\n",

            "I started using Bio Oil at the beginning of 2016 per the recommendation of my dermatologist. At the time, I had cystic acne that left behind hyperpigmentation and scarring of all different hues--purple, brown, red--all over my face, mostly on my cheeks and temples. My acne lasted up until the summer of 2017, at which point my skin cleared up for good. I have been using Bio Oil twice a day, every day, throughout this whole ordeal (2 years now) and now I have NO hyperpigmentation or scarring whatsoever on my face. Also, due to all the different products I've used while I had acne, I now have extremely dry skin. Bio Oil is great for that too! I still apply it morning and night, and I have no dry or painful patches on my face. I've recommended this product to several friends who have acne scarring and hyperpigmentation and they have experienced the same results! (Sorry no before/after photos, I didn't keep any pictures of my scarred skin!)\n",
            "This is not the authentic product the bottle is very different.And smell weird.I’ve been using bio are you open on throughout the years and I’ve never had a break out on my skin ever and no smell  until today, when I put a little bit on my hands and wrists .it cause my skin to itch and 2 small bubbles up as you can see on my right wrist.I’ll send it right back. Never again will Purchased this product from Amazon I will go to Walgreens or CVS Purchase their original one.\n",

            "Every woman (and man!) needs this stuff. I have had stretch marks on my legs since I was 13, and I feel like after using this for about 2 weeks they have started to fade. I put this on my inner thighs, breasts and scars I have on my face and it is seriously a magical oil. I would recommend this for someone who is pregnant or has irritating stretch marks.\n",

            "I've used this product for over month and realized something: I think this is counterfeit. I've paid almost twice the price for Bio-Oil from dermstore and 1) the smell is different, 2) the viscosity is different, 3) the effect is different. With derm store, I don't feel tacky after applying this post shower, my skin is so smooth and stays moisturized even 24 hours later. I remember thinking \"wow\" at how soft and smooth my butt felt the morning after my shower. With this, the oil feels thicker and it initially feels a little tacky. You would think that this would result in even more moisturized, smoother skin, but my skin doesn't get the smoothness I get from legit Bio-Oil, and legs and butt are back to their normal, rough, super dry selves.I think this is snake oil. Not the real Bio Oil but THIS specific Bio Oil from THIS specific seller on Amazon.For the past month I've been using this product trying to figure out why this Bio Oil was acting so differently. Then I smelled someone's baby oil and realized this really is working no differently than the cheap baby oil you can get at the drugstore. So if you want the same effect of THIS counterfeit Bio Oil, get it for much cheaper at the drugstore. Smells the same. Acts the same. (And without the orange dye!)If you want to see what everyone's raving about when it comes to Bio-Oil, get it from a legit retailer like derm store.Amazon's getting pretty heinous with its peddling of counterfeit products! You think it's legit when it's offered as Amazon Prime, but this is pretty shady.Anyway, I get it. It's soooo much cheaper from this seller and you want to see what the fuss is about. Once I finish this bottle (I mean, it doesn't really work, but I paid for it and it's too late to get a refund), I'm trying the Bioderma after shower oil. It's a HUGE bottle for a fraction of the cost of legit Bio Oil. And it smells really nice, too! A little like powdery violets or iris. Hopefully, since the Bioderma oil is not yet a cult product, the one I got from Amazon is not a counterfeit.\n",
            "This is genuine bio oil. It is the same packaging that Target has and is the same color and smell. Thanks to this stuff, I went through my entire pregnancy without stretch marks and it has greatly reduced the appearance of my c section scar in just a few months! Absolutely swear by this!\n",
            "Someone recommended this oil to me after I had thyroid surgery. Remarkably, it has significantly lightened my scar in the month I have been using it. I apply this product twice a day (sometimes only once when I go to bed). HIGHLY recommended!\n",
            "Healed my surgical scar beautifully!! Nice in Have in the winter\n",
            "Got this oil to help with pregnancy and avoid stretch marks. I oil up every day. Still got stretch marks. The bottle it comes out of it messy and you don’t see it when you set the bottle down but it collects around the top and as soon as you set it down it drips all over the bottle and the surface you set it on. Smells like an old lady. Was not impressed AT ALL\n",
            "I use it as legs oil, or anywhere I need extra moisture. Smells great too, absorbs very quickly and doesn't leave skin feeling greasy.\n",
            "I admit that I purchased this before looking at the ingredients.  The upbeat add sold me.  Howeve the minute I put it on, I knew that I had been bamboozled.Whatever effect people think they have found is actually no different than consistent use of a moisturizer placed on skin and the sealed with Baseline, petroleum jelly, or mineral oil.  Peep the ingredients.  The first clue that this product and its claims were hype is the fact that the oil is mostly mineral oil...the same product that undergirds all of vaseline's products.  Those clinical tests are not vigorous scientific clinical double blind trials.  The n is too small. The time span is too short. Et cetera but this does not stop them from telling you that in order to \"see improvements\" you have to use their product for 3 months.  I repeat, no better than consistently, appropriately using vaseline.Buy it if you like potions, magical thinking, and have no concern for efficacy.  Maybe this is the product for people who don't know how to properly moisturize their skin like \"dihydrogen monoxide\" is for people who want to quench extreme thirst.C'est la vie.Aside - it has a mild, offputing afterscent that I worried about everytime I used it.  It is like a \"clean\" day care bathroom.\n",
            "I received this product on or around May 30. Since receiving it, I've been using it every day, twice a day per the instructions, and I still have more than half of the bottle left! I use it in the morning before I get my day started and then again in the evening before bed. I apply generous amounts on my face neck and both of my forearms. I was a bit worried that I would go through the bottle so quickly, but I'm surprised I still have plenty.This product works well. I noticed that many of my stubborn acne scars and blemishes have faded. I had some pretty bad blemishes around my neck from tweezing and poking at in-grown hair and those have nearly disappeared, and I'm no longer embarrassed or forced to try to cover up with makeup (which obviously just made my neck worst). It has also worked well to reduce the wrinkles on my forehead and laugh marks/wrinkles, and it has even out my skin tone. I tend to scar and get dark spots from bug bites and I've found that this product also works on those. I did notice, however, that it does not work as well or quickly on more recent blemishes nor does it work on fading freckles.The product itself is moisturizing and it has replaced my daily face lotion. But it does leave my face looking oily. I'm not sure if makeup would help mattify my face (I haven't worn makeup since COVID), but since I've just been at home, the oil doesn't bother me.\n",
            "I had a total knee replacement and a friend recommended this for my scar.  I have used this 2X daily and my scar is almost gone at 4 months post surgery!  My orthopedic surgeon was very impressed by the healing of my scar so early.\n",
            "Got this as a gift when I was first pregnant. Really reduced my stretch marks and helped me not get any new ones. Much better than cocoa butter. Not greasy and quickly absorbed in the skin. I have pretty dry skin as it is, but this got me through the winter.  Loved it so much, I bought another bottle for myself when I ran out.\n"

I put it EVERYWHERE I thought of. I’m now six weeks postpartum, and no stretch marks! I plan to keep using it as it is very moisturizing too!\n",
            "This product is loaded w petroleum and mineral oil which is a big no no.. after using this product on my belly for a week My entire belly broke out in small hives/pimples. Only after switching to organic oil the hives went away... i would not recommend this product for kids or expecting moms\n",
            "Wow. This was absolutely horrendous. I used it on my face and I BROKE OUT in a terrible red rash, had bumps everywhere, my skin was all swollen and red and extremely itchy!!! It’s been a few days, been taking allergy medication and it’s changed th texture of my skin completely! It is so rough and bumpy everywhere and I am so sad. I just finished accutane and had perfect skin. This RUINED my face. PLEASE DO NOT BUY\n",
            "Although I just started to use Bio Oil I can already see a visible difference in my stretch marks. The redness has begun to subside and my skin feels soft. Looking forward to incorporating this into my daily routine, so far the results are promising!\n",
            "I’ve been using this product for a while now on a very large scar and some stretch marks. It hasn’t made much of a difference for the stretch marks, even though I’ve also lost 10lbs in the time I’ve been using this oil. The stretch marks are being very stubborn.However, it has softened the appearance of my supersized scar. It also keeps the scarred area well hydrated throughout the day, which prevents itchiness. I would say that I prefer having this oil on my scarred area as opposed to not having it.I accidentally got some of this oil on my face one morning and assumed I would breakout - very happy (and impressed!) that was not the case. It felt quite nice actually! So if you’re considering using this product on your face, it’s got my seal of approval.Overall I like this oil and enjoy the way it feels on my skin, particularly the scarred area that’s prone to dryness. Not sure if I will purchase more in the future though, since it doesn’t seem to do anything for my stretch marks. I may test out a few other products and then choose a favorite.\n",
            "The ingredients on the package of oil that I received are not the same as those listed above, which should be listed in order of prominence in the formula. The first ingredient is actually mineral oil which has a 9/10 rating for safety based on these concerns:• Cancer (moderate)• Developmental/reproductive toxicity (high)• Use restrictions (high)• Non-reproductive organ system toxicity (low)• Biochemical or cellular level changes (high)Many women are buying this because of pregnancy, so I wish I had read all this before I bought. I do like the product. It smells great, and even when i was nauseous all the time I enjoyed the smell. It doesn't absorb that quickly but I liked it. But now I am afraid to use it. It just doesn't seem worth the risk. The ingredients on my bottle match exactly the ingredients on a cosmetics safety website. I just dont know if it's worth purchasing this rather than a more safe moisturizer.\n",
            "Bio Oil has a great smell, not too strong or overwhelming and the oil is rapidly absorbed into my skin. A little does go a long way but it spreads better right after a shower for me. It doesn't work well if your skin is dry (at least, not for me) which is why I use it right after the shower. It leaves my skin very soft. I just started using it but many report it has lightened stretch marks and scars.\n",
            "So, I was nervous about using this because my legs tend to get clogged pores easily or just get irritated easily. I use this after showers and give it a bit to absorb. I do feel like my scars have soften in appearance, but this product does take time to fix skin concerns and I think you need to use it for at least 3 months to see any intended results. The smell is good and it does absorb okay (might be a little oily, but when I wake up I just have hydrated legs). I feel like it has been good for my tummy which sometimes feels like it just isn't smooth. Like how cellulite can look, but not quite the same. I do work out, but it just never looks smooth, but that is changing and this is something I have added to my routine so I feel like this is doing something. I do use Fur oil for post-shaving and this layers good with that. I did order a larger size and do feel like it works well for me.\n",
            "I was super worried about getting stretch marks during my pregnancy, especially because I had them on my boobs, lower back, and thighs from my adolescence. At two months I started using this morning and night, and made it to my delivery at 39 weeks exactly with zero stretch marks. I gained right about 40 pounds total. I’m not 100% positive that I skipped the stretch marks entirely due to this product, but I’m personally pleased with the results!\n",
            "During my previous pregnancies I used other lotions and oils to avoid stretch marks and was fortunate to only have a few relatively small stretch marks. When I found out I was pregnant with twins I began looking online for products with good reviews and came across this product and decided to give it a try. I used this religiously at least twice a day starting in the beginning of my second trimester up until my delivery date. It worked wonders! I didn’t get any stretch marks during this pregnancy and gained a significant amount of more weight with my twins than with my single pregnancies. I recommend this oil to all my pregnant friends now.\n",

I’m pregnant with Twins and used lightly on stretch marks, then a little on my legs, feet, arms and breast’s. A tiny amount was used on my belly. Within 2 days, I broke out in a nightmare rash. My fingers are covered in a pin needle flaring bumps. My legs, feet, and arms are on fire covered in the rash that is a variety of patches. Thank God there’s a minor rash on my belly since I didn’t use much on it. I hate this product and wished I would have just used something simple like coconut oil, but I trusted all these reviews and magazine articles saying it was a “miracle oil.” It’s a nightmare oil! Use of these chemicals in products should be illegal. If it works great for you, your skin must be triple thick leather. Don’t trust it! Never again!\n",

It came in one day, the box was in perfect condition, safety sealed, the bottle was perfect as well. I even asked the question how to tell the difference of a fake before hand on here and the manufacturer said there is a cross at the bottom with a batch number. It was all there. So I was testing it out and the smell is a little cinnamon-y atleast to me. It absorbed really well and I didn’t need much product. Will update in a bout a month or so after using the product consistently.\n",
            "I’m writing a review based on my first day of usage. The scent is like cinnamon.  Which I wasn’t sure I could get used to. But either my nose acclimated really fast to the scent or the scent dissipates once spread onto your skin.  The oil is not greasy when your in it into your skin. Unlike Neutrogena sesame oil. But I really like being able to use the neutrogena oil on wet or dry skin and the bio oil can only be applied on dry skin. Now compared to the Nuxe Huile multipurpose oil the Bio oil is a better deal.  But the Nuxe is almost like a perfume so I don’t bother wearing perfume when I use the Nuxe. The Nuxe is not greasy but leaves a little more of a sheen than the bio oil.  But the bio oil claims to even out skin tone...I will use this oil for three weeks and give another review to see if it has evened out my skin tone.\n",
            "I have used bio oil for the two years and it helped me overcome many skin issues like dark spots, stretch marks, oily face, etc...But for the last 5 months (weirdly since they started selling bio oil in groceries stores like Walmart or costco) the product quality has gone down slope.1. The prices keep changing and getting ridiculously expensive for no reason. I used to buy the 4.2pz bottle for $10 top before tax and as I am writing this review it is almost $16 !!I did signal this to Amazon and got an automated corporate response.2. The oil is normally a bright pink coral color. But lately the color is flimsy pale orange. Maybe color tangible chrmically but the quality is so much cheaper.Plus the oil is making me break out !I would say if you can buy something else just do it. At least until the product returns to its golden days\n",
            "I'm returning it! It is packed with mineral oil ( read: distillate of petroleum). Better find out what it does for your body. I would call it liquid cancer. Just can't believe it has so many good reviews..... people don't read ingredients.. and don't understand them.ALSO before ordering I had checked ingredients in old version I have (purchased 4 years ago or so) and it didn't have mineral oil in it.\n",
            "The natural, plant oil ingredients are heavily promoted but there is a long list of chemical ingredients as well and I am not a fan. The scent is nice, like baby oil, which of course is another added chemical but it is what it is. I've read multiple reviews for Bio-Oil over the years and most of them were good. I bought it mainly to use on my keloid scars to smooth out their appearance. So far I have only applied twice (just got it yesterday afternoon) but upon waking this morning, the scar tissue already felt considerably softer and wasn't as rough feeling/looking. My pores weren't clogged either. Usually if something is going to cause me to break out, it does it quickly, so waking up to clogged pores wouldn't be out of the ordinary for me if this affected them. It is very greasy though. I added it to a roller bottle for easier and consistent application and it does take time for it to absorb into the skin and even then, it doesn't completely and is still too greasy feeling for my personal tastes (especially in the summer heat). What I have done both times I have applied the thin layer is allow it to soak in for about 30 minutes or so while I do other things and then blot off the excess with a tissue. I am anticipating that for daytime application, I will have to blot more than once as it gets hotter outside. I am not sure how anyone who wears makeup would be able to use this under it.FYI: It was a toss up between trying this and some of those silicone scar sheets but I didn't really want to walk around with a large bandage on my face all day long (they have to stay on for at least 12 hours). So, my plan is to finish this small bottle of Bio-Oil and then see where I am at before continuing or trying the silicone sheets or finding a way to use the natural ingredients on this product and make my own. I am giving 3 stars for now mainly because of the chemicals.\n",
            "I LOVE BIO OIL. its the best investment i have ever made in my skin care routine. I don’t even need to use face masks daily anymore. I just wash my face morning & night-apply alcohol free witch hazel toner & then bio oil. A little goes a long way. I use to get regular acne break outs but since this product i would rarely get any pimples. I swear on everything this is the best formula for your skin. Forget all those other expensive products & go for this. I even introduced this oil to my friends & family where they are using it now too. I apply it on other parts of my body as well. It whitened my elbows, knees & leaves my body feeling soft & smooth. I’ve been using this product for about 5 months now & my face is so clear. People always ask me how im always glowing with radiance even without makeup.\n",
            "I had a breast surgery in the fall of 2019 and it left me with the notorious lollipop scar that was a dark purple color, I started using this oil in April 2020 it is now July 2020 and my scars are almost completely faded to a very light pink skin tone color I am on my 3rd bottle. It also works really well for tattoos! I use sunscreen on my body art but after time in the sun and dry skin my tattoos started to look faded, I apply my oil after I shower and all my tattoos look like I just got fresh ink!  This is now my daily oil I use from head to toe.I was in no way paid or given a discount for my review, I have had great results with using it everyday and thats the only reason for the 5 stars.\n",
            "I have used Bio Oil for several years and find it to be a good product. I’ve gone through many bottles, and while it hasn’t erased my stretch marks, I believe it has helped to blend in and lessen its harsh appearance (my stretch marks are deep and used to be purple and red a long time ago, but now the pigment is more skin toned). I am tan skinned and it has done well on my tone. It’s moisturizing and I like to believe it does great things for my skin. It’s safe to use while breastfeeding and pregnant, which is a bonus. The scent of Bio Oil is very distinct and strong, but I personally don’t mind it too much because I put it on before bed so no one smells it but me.As far as the product itself goes, I like it. However, I’m giving three stars because my bottle just arrived today and looks like it’s missing product (view attached photo). None of it spilled into the box... it makes me question either it’s authenticity or if it was used and returned. I will be looking elsewhere to purchase this product.\n"

            "I was hesitant to purchase on here with all the reviews stating this was fake; but I’m really glad I took the chance! I haven’t used bio oil since my first pregnancy (3 years ago) but the scent and consistency of this bottle purchased on amazon is exactly as I remember my bottle from years ago purchased at target being. Has the same light scent and absorbs very well. I mix it with the palmers coconut oil lotion and it works amazing! My skin feels so moisturized and soft. Super happy with myPurchase and glad I took the chance of buying it on here!\n",
            "I am pregnant and bought this because I heard it's amazing to help prevent stretch marks.  I currently am mixing it with shea tummy butter and putting it on my stomach, breast, thighs, and butt.  It smells great.  I plan on using it twice a day.\n",
            "I can't honestly say this helps remove the look of scars or stretch marks (I'm not sure anything is really a \"miracle product\"), but I can tell you that it is a light oil that dries quickly and doesn't leave you with a greasy feel or sticky residue. It goes on well, absorbs well, and is a great moisturizer. It has a nice clean scent to it. I always use this during and after pregnancy (I'm on #2 right now) and while I still have some marks from my first am hoping with keeping things moisturized there won't be more after this one.I use this on my face too (putting the residual from my stomach and sides on my face when I'm done) and I love it for a facial moisturizer! I do think it has helped brighten my freckled face a bit. And if it's possible to even a freckled, pale face - it has done that. I do not have the splotches of red or rough places on my cheeks after using this for a few weeks.Try it. You'll find benefit from it one way or another.\n",
            "Anybody looking to reduce stretch marks from pregnancy or even just weight gain please read this! I’ve tried SO many things and honestly nothing worked while I was pregnant so I’m pretty sure genetics got me there. But I’ve been using bum bum cream all over my stomach in combo with bio oil (not combining, separately I wait for one to dry before applying another. Then I use nivea deep nourishing serum lotion all over my stretch marks during the day. I drink tons of water to make sure my skin is staying hydrated (drink half your body weight in water to keep hydrated for your body) & all of this seems to have worked! After about a month my stretch marks went from dark dark to super faint some barely visible. Even my fiancé noticed a huge difference. I’m wanting to lose a significant amount of weight so I started a diet and recently started using sugar scrubs all over and exfoliating & using a dry brush after showers before applying these creams to try to avoid loose skin but the results I saw came before I started that. Hope this helps someone.\n",
            "Okay, I can’t say good enough things about this product!1.) Q: Does it diminish the appearance of scars and stretch marks? A: YES! I have had four children and struggle with deep stretch marks, and I also suffer from a chronic condition under arms that causes scarring. Both of which have diminished (not completely disappeared mind you) over a two month period of time. I use as direct, twice a day.2.) Q: Does it have any side effects for people with sensitive skin? A: My skin is prone to sensitivity, but I have not experienced any issues whatsoever.3.) Q: Does this work as a moisturizer? A: Absolutely! I use this after bathing each day, and I love the silky feel of my skin along with the fresh, somewhat baby powder scent. I’ve also used it on freshly shaved skin, and to my dismay it has treated razor burn and razor bumpsI absolutely love this product and am getting ready to purchase my next bottle. This will be a product I will continue to use as long as they continue to produce it.\n",
            "First of all: scent! Everyone was describing the smell as a perfume smell- it's not. It's basically like pure cinnamon extract. I bought this product in the small size as a test for my face. I read all about the reduction in stretch marks so decided to try that as well without much expectation. I had my daughter 10 years ago- and since using this product my 10 YEAR OLD STRETCH MARKS ARE DISAPPEARING! I cannot BELIEVE it! I didn't even think it was possible! It's been a great product for my face as well, using in conjunction with Sydney Riley's Lactic Acid treatment (a product I've been using for over a year). My skin is more even, rejuvenated and glowing! I'm 35 with very fair skin, not super sensitive. This will definitely be a permanent fixture in my skin regimen!\n",
            "This stuff is AMAZING! I have only been using it for 6 or 7 weeks and it has made such a difference in a large scar that just wasn’t healing. The picture that is a little darker is from before I started using the oil and that is 1 year after the initial injury. The lighter picture is the same scar after using the oil twice a day for about 6 weeks. This has done more for my scar than anything else I have tried. It’s a great price and works wonders!  I did try it on my face for extra moisture, but it did give me some pimples even though it says it is comedogenic, I would not recommend for your face. I have used it on other parts of my body to help with dryness and it has done a great job for that too!\n",
            "I know there are a lot of genetics involved in stretch marks for preggos but I'm on my 2nd pregnancy and still no stretch marks. I use this every night after the shower. They only annoying this is that it is very liquidy and takes a long time to dry. I wouldn't do this right before bed as it will get all over everything. But otherwise, seems to be working beautifully! And I love the smell!\n",
            "This oil was recommended to me by few of my girl friends back in Europe. Each one of them swore that prevented them from getting a stretch marks. My first thought was that this is too good to be true but decided to give it a try even though I though it was priced little higher than I would like it to be.  My order arrived quickly and I was eager to try it right away. At that time I was little over 3 months pregnant and my stomach was staring to grow. It’s recommended to use it in the morning and at night. I end up using it only in the evenings during the week and the days I was off I was suing it twice a day. Been using it during the whole pregnancy. I Was holding off to review the product so I can see the results for myself. I am happy to report that my skin doesn’t have not even one little stretch mark after I gave birth.Pros:Must have- amazing long lasting moistureNo stretch marks after using the product(for me at least worked like a miracle)Cons:I wasn’t not able to use in the morning under my clothes for work because it’s very moisturizing/ oily and I was scared to damaged my dresses\n",

This product is full of toxic ingredients such as coumarin - shown yo cause liver damage and retinyl palmitate. Here is a direct quote from the EWG on retinyl palmitate:Too much preformed vitamin A, including retinol, retinyl palmitate, retinyl acetate and retinyl linoleate, can cause a variety of health problems, including liver damage, brittle nails, hair loss, and osteoporosis and hip fractures in older adults. Excessive vitamin A can also cause serious skeletal birth defects in a developing fetus. For that reason, Norwegian health authorities have cautioned women who are pregnant or breastfeeding to avoid cosmetic products with vitamin A (Norwegian SCFS 2012b).Please protect your baby and use something else!\n",
            "This oil is honestly incredible. It actually works. I use it for my deep stretch marks and scarring on my stomach and thighs. It has a nice powdery smell too. The only thing is it is very greasy, but worth the trouble! I see some reviewers are saying that they received a fake product, and their pictures confirm that.. for that reason, I would say probably safer to purchase direct rather than through the Amazon seller.\n",
            "AMAZING!!! Im very pale so any scars or blemishes or really any “imperfections” show up very easily on me. I have some nasty self harm scars from a while back and after only two times using the oil my scars have looked so much better and less nasty and dark. worse scars are still the same but the noticeable change in some of them made me really happy! (I would add a picture but I don’t want to accidentally trigger anybody)~It’s also super moisturizing! I have dry skin and was ready for this to not do much but i was wrong. It moisturized my skin perfectly (remember that a little goes a long way!) and made my skin feel so smooth and soft 🥰\n",
            "So far so good. I've been using it for almost a week. It is lightweight and smells nice. I love the bottle it comes in. Definitely ended up liking this product way more than expected, and I do feel like I see a difference already. Either way, it definitely helps to make my skin so soft and well moisturized. I use it in combination with the burt's bees mommy tummy cream! Perfect combo.\n",
            "After hearing good things about Bio- Oil, I purchased & have used this for the past week in attempt to ward of the stretch marks I am expecting with my pregnancy. I am trying the 2oz option (rather than committing to a larger bottle) to see if I like it.Pro - I like the scent; it almost smells like honeysuckle.Con - it's not cruelty free & I wish I had researched that better before purchasing. I will look for a cruelty free product next time.As for quality of the product, I cannot comment as I have not been using it long enough. It does moisturize very well and has staying power.\n",
            "This oil is the best for preventing pregnancy stretch marks & dry skin! I used this everyday on my belly & other dry areas & it prevented any stretch marks that I know otherwise would have appeared, which is why I’ve ordered the large bottle for my second pregnancy.\n",
            "I feel like the redness and irritation on my skin have gotten better after just a few applications! I have PCOS, which also gives me these darker patches of skin on my neck and inner thighs and this seems to have really improved that already too!The scent is something between baby lotion and medicinal, but it’s not offensive.I’ve been putting this on as part of my morning and evening routine (it recommended using it twice a day) my skin stays hydrated all day but not oily like I was worried about, it seems to absorb fairly quickly! I will definitely be making this a permanent part of my skin care routine and buying more.\n",
            "I rarely ever write reviews, but this is probably my favorite beauty/body care product of ALL TIME!A dear friend recommended this product to me nearly a decade ago after I was left with an ugly scar after surgery.  She had used this post-mastectomy and raved about how well it diminished her scars and made her skin more supple.I used it and was hooked!  In all fairness, I am not sure how well my scar would have faded on its own had I not used this, but it worked so well and so quickly to smooth my skin and soften the scar tissue on my knee, I ended up using it as an allover body moisturizer!I now use this religiously after I shower.  I can tell my skin \"misses it\" if I go more than a day or so without using it.  My results were so impressive, my husband now uses it as his daily moisturizer!Also, the smell is divine!  It reminds me a tiny bit of Chanel No 5, but very, very subtle and does not interfere with my fragrances.  Obviously, not an overpowering or particularly \"feminine\" scent, as my husband uses it and does not find that it interferes with his fragrance, nor is it too \"girly\" for him.All in all, this is the best beauty product of ALL TIME!\n",
            "Discovered during pregnancy & have been using it daily ever since. I apply it after showering all over my abdomen, hips, thighs. I've found this product to reduce & prevent stretch marks during & following pregnancy. The oil has a light fresh scent which quickly fades. It is super hydrating & quickly absorbs with no greasy residue. Well worth the price - best price on Amazon!\n"

It restored my skin's soft, smooth texture and has faded the discoloration. At 75+ years of age, I look years younger and am very pleased. I have been using it 2x a day for a little over a year and discontinued other cosmetic moisturizers for my face. Excellent results, simple to use and affordable.\n",
            "Ok wow... this stuff is amazing. I gained some COVID weight... 35lbs to be exact which is the biggest I personally have ever been which means, yep! Stretch marks... They're on the back of my thighs and side of my thighs. I'm pretty diligent about moisturizing after showers and before bed but that didn't help the stretch marks go away while they're still in the purple phase. I've used this serum, with a lotion on top of it (that's how serums work, paired with a moisturizer), for only 3 APPLICATIONS, that's it, and they've already softened and faded. Way less prominent and obvious. Buy this stuff! I can't speak for stretch marks or scars that are already settled in, but if you're still in the purple/pink/red phase then this will be a huge help.\n",
            "I'm prone to stretch marks. I know this after ending puberty with my hips and derriere covered with them and no, I did not gain weight as a teenager. At 6 feet tall the most I weighed was 125lbs back then. My mom has a belly full of stretch marks as well.  That being said,  when hubby and I started trying to conceive stretch marks were a concern for me. I did not want them on my tummy. After looking at reviews I decided to go with bio oil. This combined with Palmers Coco butter straight out of the shower every night and most mornings were my saving grace during pregnancy. These pictures were taken the week before I gave birth. NOT ONE STRETCH MARK.  I would recommend this to anyone.  As for the smell, I personally loved it even throughout my pregnancy.\n",
            "The safety seal was missing and the product's cardboard box appeared to have been opened previously as it was bent around the edges. I tested some of it on my hands and it felt extremely greasy, sticky, and watery. This greasiness is not normal for Bio-oil. I believe this product is a fake or has been watered down with mineral oil or vegetable oil. I'm returning this product because every Bio-oil I've bought has always had the safety seal and I have no confidence in this seller. Scent smells normal if you sniff the bottle, but once you put it on your hands and aired it out, the smell was too strong, much stronger than the normal fragrance in Bio-oil.\n",
            "I have used this with my two previous pregnancies and have started to use it again for my third pregnancy. I have had minimal stretch marks which I got in my first pregnancy. During my first pregnancy I found out fairly late and feel had I used the item sooner I could have avoided the stretch marks I have now. The oil itself smells great and it is great on my sensitive skin. I’ve suffered with eczema since my childhood and never have had any adverse reaction to this product. The product leaves your skin feeling moisturized and helps give overall elasticity to the skin. Your skin will feel as smooth as a baby’s bottom in no time. As a recommendation I would not stop using my lotion I use on a daily basis but use this in conjunction with this. I also find I get the most benefit from this product when I use it right after a shower. And also at night so my skin has more time to absorb it.\n",
            "It works!!!! I have only ever had stretch marks on my boobs so I never really cared until suddenly I started getting them on my arms and stomach area and I was absolutely horrified and embarrassed so I would wear long sleeved shirts in 85 degree weather and things that would cover my stomach and refused to go to the beach eith my family. I stumbled upon this and started using only once even though it instructs twice a day for the max results however just once a day and it worked like from angry purple Mark's to where I didnt see the after effects of the stretch Mark's. It truly is a wholly grail when so many other products never worked. One thing I dont like is how hard it is to wash off my hands even after many washes but i found ways of avoid getting it on my hands.\n",
            "I love Bio-Oil and I was so glad to see it in such a big bottle. This product is amazing for reducing scars and stretch marks--not just fading them they actually are reducing the depth of some of my deeper stretch marks they are almost completely even with the surrounding skin and I have only been through a little over half the 2 oz size bottle. I apply a little twice a day and exfoliate the areas with a scrub twice a week and I have seen amazing progress in less than a month. I would highly recommend this product.\n",

            "I liked the way it smelled and how it didn't feel heavy/greasy so I'm giving it 3 stars. Unfortunately after using it one time on my surgery scars I had a severe allergic reaction to it. I had tested it on the inner part of my arm before hand and had no issues but I guess the scar tissue was more sensitive. I'm assuming I must be allergic to one of the flowers in it. As a warning to all, you can have a pretty bad reaction to it like I did. My scars look absolutely horrible now, the hives I got went all along of scars [all the way across my entire torso] and made the scaring triple in thickness and bump out. The swelling from the reaction lasted for a week, the hives and intense itching/burning lasted for almost 3 weeks and I am still suffering from random itchiness and some noticeable hives are still along my scars. I won't post a picture of the reaction because it was pretty disgusting looking, it was extremely red, covered in hives, and leaking clear fluid. I don't have really sensitive skin or anything so I did not expect this kind of reaction. My scars are really bad now and theres really nothing I can do about it.\n",
            "I had high hopes for this product as it was very well recommended. However, it didn't work for me at all. No lighter color, no smaller scars or stretch marks. I used it in several areas of different sizes. It just didn't work for me. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. The color of oil I got is MUCH lighter than the original bottles my friends and family have as well. I think this may be part of the problem. Maybe I got a bad batch or maybe the seller is being deceptive. Who knows. Didn't work though.\n",
            "I used this 2xs a day morning and night and sometimes 3xs a day on gym days after a shower during my entire pregnancy. Both sides of my family got stretch marks from pregnancy I assumed I would too. I used this product faithfully even before my baby bump grew I started about month 2 in my pregnancy once I found out I was pregnant. I never got a single stretch mark. Perhaps it was this product or just genetics, staying hydrated or all of the above I don’t know but I think it’s worth the try and money because I didn’t get any. I used it on my face in the morning and night even before I apply makeup for my dry skin and it works great. I would say get it it’s worth the money! But use it faithfully... if your using it for stretch mark prevention.\n",
            "I used this throughout my pregnancy from 4 months on (that was when I started showing) until I gave birth - I diligently put it on my belly every morning before work and always after showers.  I have 0 stretch marks, yes you read that correctly - zero, zilch, nada, stretch marks from my pregnancy.  I would highly, highly recommend this product and I will most certainly use it again for future pregnancies.\n",
            "This is the best product on the market!  I had skin that looked like sand paper and was worried about the \"prune look\" so I set out to try many products and overlooked price which resulted in a hole in my pocket.  The outcome; I tried petroleum jelly and that made me break out with a rash.  Finally, I found Bio-Oil and wow, I looked hydrated and I paid such a small amount of money.  Best of all, I wasn't greasy.  After a few minutes, the oil seeped in and I looked radiant!  So thrilled!  Now, I am using it on my dry hair and it is working.  So very grateful for this product.  Yesterday, I ordered a bigger bottle.\n",
            "As the title says I'm currently 39 weeks and I still haven't seen any stretch marks appear on my skin. I know it's largely hereditary, but my mom and grandma got plenty of stretch marks during pregnancy and so far I've escaped unscathed. I started using this daily around 17 weeks. I hardly even had a bump, but it felt nice and was a way to pamper myself. Now that I'm close to giving birth my belly is definitely big and the oil has been so nice to have. I bought a few lotions for stretch marks and pregnancy and I honestly really don't like them much. The oil absorbs nicely and instantly gets rid of the itchiness I get from my skin being so tight. I wouldn't be upset if I did get stretch marks as I know they're hard/impossible to truly prevent, but I'm happy so far I'm still clear of them and I'd still use this regardless cuz it feels so soothing on my skin. Also I have really sensitive skin that rashes easily and turns red and this hasn't given me any issues. The scent is mild, and possibly not something everyone would like but I have no issues with it. Plus since the smell is mild its not noticable anymore after it absorbs.\n",
            "As you have read/or heard, stretch marks are mostly genetics but i think your social habits and pre weight/pregnancy weight gain factor into getting stretch marks too. My mom and two sisters got stretch marks during pregnancy, however, I did not. I gained approx 20 lbs during pregnancy and being 6 weeks postpartum now I am back at my weight before pregnancy. I used this oil intermittently for the first 4 months of pregnancy because I was too sick to “care” to apply it everyday and the scent of the oil made me feel nauseous. But into my 2nd and 3rd trimester I used it 1-2 x a day, everyday. The consistency of the oil is similar to an oil based lubricant such as jojoba oil. I’m sensitive to smells so the smell to me is quite strong and somewhat unpleasant. If you have morning sickness you may not like it. As you can see from the photos I did not get stretch marks but I’m not sure if it’s more so my genetics/minimal weight gain or that the oil helped. What I do know is that I put the oil on other areas I have stretch marks and it did not seem to make a difference such as lighten them. I would recommend to at least try and use it everyday to see if it makes a difference for you since it won’t hurt.\n",
            "I have been using this for a couple months now and haven't really noticed much of a difference with my scars.  It has a pleasant scent, absorbs quickly, and isn't greasy, so thats a plus.  I probably won't buy it again, but I don't regret this purchase.  Sometimes you just need to try stuff to see if it works for you.  This, in terms of lightening my old scars not so much, but its fine otherwise.  The instructions recommend 3 months of use so I will continue to use it until it is gone, if my scars change I will amend this review.\n",
            "I bought this oil because of the great reviews I saw but when I started applying it my skin got scaly dry patches and when I read more of the reviews some of the comments were suggesting it is fake so I bought another bio oil from ulta and I tested both the one I got from Amazon was oily and my skin didn't absorb it but when I applied the one that I bought from ulta my skin absorbed it and it wasn't sitting on top of my skin. I discarded the oil I bought from Amazon and my skin is going back to normal. I never had a dry scaly skin before applying the oil I got from this seller.i also was disappointed that it doesn't have a safty seal .\n",
            "I used this product for my first pregnancy and I'm using it again for my second pregnancy.  I'm not someone who likes body oils or lotions that feel too oily, but, like most pregnant women i know, I am scared of getting stretch marks.  At the recommendation of the internet, I ordered this and gave it a try.  Firstly, the smell is strong and florally.  I am not one sensitive to smells, but if smells irritate you in the slightest, do not buy.  The scent lingers on your skin and clothes even hours after you've applied it.  Application wise, i felt like i needed a lot of the product to get good belly coverage (example, i need a whole palm-full to cover my current 24 week pregnant belly, including hips).  One bottle lasted me an entire pregnancy, with daily application starting around 20 weeks.  Feel wise, as the name suggests, it is oily.  BUT, i love the way it made my stomach/skin feel.  It prevented itching from the stretching that occurred as my stomach grew, and the softness and moisture lasted over night and into the next day.  I had 0 stretch marks from my first pregnancy, currently, at 24 weeks, I have zero again.  I will continue to use this pregnancy and any future pregnancy!  Very happy with the product.\n"

It also got rid of my ‘Chicken skin’ (Red bumps on legs and arms). I really wish I took a before and after photo for comparison. I will try to post one soon to document progress.Honestly I use this oil all over my body. I’m extremely satisfied with my purchase. It’s an amazing price for what it can accomplish.\n",
            "I am using this stuff for my newly acquired stretch marks from gaining weight since covid started and I couldn’t go to the gym. I never got any stretch marks while I was pregnant so I was pretty upset when I noticed I had pretty bad deep ones on my inner thighs and some on my love handles. I use it twice a day at night and morning so far I haven’t noticed much but it has helped a little. I’ve only been using it for a couple weeks though and it said about a month or two until you see the actual results. It’s very moisturizing and doesn’t have a very strong smell. The light smell it does have is nice too. I will update in a month or two to let you all know if it continues to help or is just a bust. A lot of people I know swear by it though and my legs are super soft now!\n",
            "It's hard for me to give this product an accurate rating since I don't use this product as often as recommended, so I'll give the most honest review I can of this product.I ordered this product 3 weeks after delivering my first child to help reduce the appearance of stretch marks.The good:The product came quickly and is described correctly. The product has a nice, simple smell that is somewhat floral but not overwhelming or overpowering. The oil is thin and is soothing to the skin. I have sensitive skin and I know that some women get stretch marks in these sensitive areas, but have found no problems using this product. I apply this product to my sides and bikini area. You need very little of this product for application. The oil doesn't stain or leave a residue on the skin. It is easily washed off hands.The bad:This product isn't cheap, but more reasonable than other products on the market. The container I ordered was very small (2oz) and it cost roughly $8 dollars. The product doesn't come in a very application-friendly bottle. I wish this came in more of a squirt bottle fashion. The bottle has a hole on the top where you can gently pour some onto your finger tips and apply to the desired areas. But since this product is expensive, you don't want to waste it, and it's easy to spill with the way the container is designed. The company recommends to apply this to the desired areas twice a day for 3 months to see improvement. I've been using this product (not twice a day...who has time for that with kids??) a few times a week after every shower and have not seen improvement yet. My stretch marks are small (thank goodness) but they are very dark purple. I will continue to use this product until it's gone to see if my stretch marks improve.Side note:I have been using this product a few times per week for 1 month and still have SO much. You can't even tell that I have used this product at all, since you don't need much for application. I recommend buying a smaller bottle to try first.\n",
            "I actually can't tell you if this is effective or not.  I can't use it because of the perfume used in it is very strong and, to me, offensive.  My surgery was delayed, so I didn't need it when I thought I would, and consequently it was too late to return it when I realized I would be unable to use it.  I'm considering mixing it with something else now to get the benefits and to be able to use it - but honestly - the smell is so overwhelming and difficult for me to handle that I don't imagine that will work. I'm planning to make my own concoction from recipes on the internet now.  I'll check each ingredient before I add it.It's almost as if they think the Bio-Oil should function as a perfume.  Just awful - so disappointed.\n",
            "02/12: i have sensitive skin and this has already reduced redness after 3 uses! i have insanely bad acne on my chin, but this helps lessen the redness. i do have sensitive skin myself and i personally like the smell! i haven’t used it for long but it hasn’t 100% taken away my acne scars. i’ll just have to continue and hope it does!UPDATE 03/14: i skip days of using this and i also use birth control and sometimes wash my face w/ other products (i should more, but 🤷🏻‍♀️) on to the review! so i have bad acne scars from picking at my chin due to hormonal acne since i was like 17-18! dude this has been clearing it up like no tomorrow, they’ve always been super red and a little bit goes a long ways! it’s one of my biggest insecurities. i also had some between my eyebrows and they’re completely gone. my chin is fading but isn’t completely gone yet, but i have noticed more of a change using this than any other product and i’ve used soooo many, even super expensive ones. i love this and will continue to update. :)\n",
            "My first pregnancy I used this product until I ran out, when I ran out I had a few other tummy options including Mederma, Coco Butter brands, etc. My stomach was looking great so I tried the others. Within a few weeks of switching brands I found my skin starting to itch and feel significantly tighter and before I knew it stretch marks were popping up everywhere. It could have just been the timing of when I ran out of Bio-Oil but this time I will be using it my entire pregnancy. Many of my friends swear by it - at the end of the day I know a lot of it is genetic but it is nice to feel moisturized as your belly is growing. This product has been incredibly moisturizing didn't ruin my clothes - although I do let it dry before putting on my clothing and don't wear materials that might be extremely susceptible to ruin.\n",
            "I was really hoping to like this and I just don't. The smell reminds me of a worse version of that Avon skin so soft from 10 years ago. It's not the worst but it's not great either. I did have a few problems with it that make me regret buying it at all.One it does not absorb into my skin so much as sit on top of it. It makes it impossible to use it under makeup because it stays greasy all day. Even using only a few drops all over my whole face is somehow too much.Two I had to stop using on my face after a week because it was giving me horrible blackheads.Three it did absolutely nothing for my stretch marks. There was no change in color or size.Four it was drying out the skin on my face. As oily as it is, it was only covering up dry patches, not making them better.I will admit it did lighten a burn scar on my chest, but only a bit and it is by no means gone. I get different people have different skin but it just didn't work for me. I'll probably keep using it on the stretch marks and the burn until the bottle runs out, but I don't expect much to change. I will 100% NOT use it on my face again.\n",
            "I'm a 65 year old seasoned citizen. I used Bio-Oil in the past; years ago when I had a hysterectomy and again for a knee surgery. Now that my skin is becoming more uneven toned and really looking aged, I have decided to go back to this oil. It helped me before and I a believe it will again. I've banged my ankles on an expensive rocking chair that has a pointed base. It's so sharp that I had to cut two tennis balls and place them on the sharp points of the rocker at the base. I am hoping the oil will get my ankles back to looking normal, as well as, the rest of my  body. I purchased the 6.7 oz because I know this will be a long process; my skin will not return to normal over night but after 2-3 months I should start seeing some good results. If you need a good body oil for unevenness, then give this a try. It may take a while but it is worth it. The oil goes into the skin and is not as thick as some of the others.\n",
            "This has been great! Only have been using off & on for a couple months, and I’ve already noticed it lighten certain dark areas of the skin/scars.I’ve been using it as a preventative option for stretch marks during pregnancy. It leaves my skin SO soft. Just like any other oil, you have to be aware of how much you apply. You are able to use a generous amount over a large area. I will be restocking for after the baby!\n"

            "This is my second time purchasing this product. I was sold on this product late last year. I am all about skincare. What I love about this oil is that it can be used all over the body. It has a delicate fragrance that is not overpowering and the oil itself leaves your skin soft. You can apply this on your face before your foundation which works amazingly! This has helped my dry t-zone area and also great for chapped skin. It has also helped a few scars too. I HIGHLY recommend this product as a daily skincare product to use and to add to your routine. It's affordable and a little goes a long way! PS, if you find your skin looking aged and dehydrated, it helps so much OMG!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE\n",
            "This product isn't fake. It even says on the top of the bottles package, \"New Look, Same Formula\" or something like that. I even checked their website and yes, the brand recently changed its look. The smell may be slightly different, but I also had my old bottle for a loooong time, so the smell probably is slightly different.Also comparing the size of bottles saying they sent fake product... this is available in different size bottles.The 2 oz bottle is plenty for quite a while. I had the larger size before and it started going brown by the end because I had it for probably 5+ years.Anyway, as for the product. It has done wonders for my keratosis pilaris on the backs of my arms. I apply while my skin is wet right after turning off the shower and it keeps the back of my arms moisturized for days, so the skin doesn't get as rough and bumpy. Is it completely gone? No, but its a huge improvement.It has an herbal type smell but I got used to it and like it now.Great product!!!!\n",
            "I used it it’s helping to get out of your markes\n",
            "I'm often pretty skeptical of products on Amazon even with great reviews because a lot of companies offer discounts for leaving a good review. This company does not do that, and they do say that you have to use the oil religiously twice a day for about 3 months to see results, I used almost the entire bottle and let me tell you, this stuff works. It's a very light scent and smells good and its super moisturizing. I was not pregnant I just had some really bad stretch marks on my belly from gaining weight very quickly and they've been there for a while so I wasn't sure this would help. It has taken all of the redness away from the marks and they are barely visible. Yay bio-oil. I'm about to buy my second bottle to see if I can completely get rid of the marks but the 75% reduction is worth it to say the least.\n",
            "El producto es una mezcla de aceites, tiene una fragancia fuerte más no intolerable. En cuanto a cicatrices y marcas no note ninguna diferencia pero debo decir que después que se va el óleo en la piel, la deja radiante y más firme. Toma en cuenta que si tienes una piel grasa esto no va funcionar para ti, ya que la mezcla si es un poco pesada. Si decides comprarlo recomiendo usarlo por las noches y que no tengas que salir a la calle ya que la piel queda excesivamente brillosa\n",
            "At the beginning of the year, I developed a rash on both of my lower legs.  It was bad enough that I went to the dermatologist and got a prescription for an ointment.  That cleared up the rash, but left my legs rough and dry in large patches.  All the body lotion in the world wouldn't budge the dryness.  I tried jojoba, marula, rosehip oils with a little bit of success, but they only provided marginal improvement.  I found Bio Heal on Amazon while looking for something else to try.  This only arrived a few days ago but it is already improving the condition of my skin on my legs.  I can see real progress after only a couple of days use.  The skin is finally softening and the dry patches have disappeared.  You can bet when I get down to the end of this bottle I'll be restocking.  I don't ever want to be without this oil again!\n",
            "This product is not for sensitive skin! I had purchased this item for my stretch marks specifically. The product highlights it’s multi-use but that is not the case at all! I applied this to my triceps and developed a very bad rash after applying it twice (like instructed on bottle). Don’t risk your skin! For those thinking why didn’t you patch test? I did and nothing had happened on the first application. It was the second time I used it that I got the irritation. I have filed for a return and will not use product again! VERY UNSATISFIED.\n",
            "Quite amazing moisturizer and goes on super smooth. I'm in my 23 weeks of pregnancy and I don't think I have any stretch marks or will have any stretch marks.\n",
            "The reviews saying this was a knock off freaked me out so much, I immediately went to target and bought a the smaller size to confirm! Target is on left and Amazon is on right. Both are the exact same color and exact same gross “cinnamon-y old lady” smell. Despite the smell, I’m having an eczema outbreak as well as going into my second trimester of pregnancy, so I’m looking forward to hopefully the magic of Bio Oil that I’ve read about!\n",
            "I’m very stretch mark prone. I have marks from growth spurts during adolescence. I used this for my first pregnancy on my belly, but I had my first baby at 31 weeks due to preeclampsia- so I never got any stretch marks on my belly. I did however get some in my hips- where I didn’t use bio oil. So I remembered for my second pregnancy to also put it on my hips! This second pregnancy I used bio oil every morning and night liberally, and towards the last couple weeks I would even put it on mid day (during my toddlers nap time). I would also use Sky Organics Shea butter at night with the bio oil, recommended by another reviewer.  I liberally applied to belly and hips- and thankfully I didnt get any new stretch marks! I’m going to use this nightly now that I’ve had my baby, as my stomach stretched back to normal.\n",

I usually put it on after a shower and then again before bed.It is fabulous, you guys! seriously.I'm Pakistani and have a slight more dark caramel complexion with hyper pigmentation on multiple parts of my body (chin, elbows, knees, bikini area etc.). After consistent use all over, the hyper pigmentation has faded SO MUCH, my arm pit stretch marks, booty stretch marks and some scarring has improved significantly.The moisturizing aspect of it is great cause I use the oil instead of lotion.PLUS it smells great! I often use it during a massage session as well.I loved this product so much that I got 4 more for family and friends!Would HIGHLY recommend.\n",
            "I’ve only been using for two months. What I noticed within that time was the radiance and this sort of youthful glow whenever I applied the oil. On days when I skipped or forget the application, I do notice my skin/face looked tired and dehydrated.  So on that note of skin being nourished and being supple, it definitely met those expectations. Now on the scar lightening/removing claims I have yet to really see any of those improvements, though I understand that to achieve those takes a longer time and full commitment. I have seen a couple spots disappear and reappear now and then, or was that my dirty mirror...wait....lol.  With that said, the fragrance is pleasant and although a little thicker in viscosity than other oils, it applies easily—-seriously you only need two dabs on your palm for your whole face. Probably use less if you have oily skin.  I’m pretty sure I’ll buy this again because that skin nourishment really makes you look like you’ve turned back the hands of time.\n",
            "Not a big fan of this. I had read so many reviews on it, and that it was recommended on scars by others. For me, personally, the fragrance is unpleasant and overpowering. They could scale it down 10 notches or get rid of it altogether. Additionally, it contains BHT as a preservative. I don't love it overall. I may use it up on my feet, but anywhere closer to my face makes the smell punch me in the nose. I recommend using pure sea buckthorn seed oil or rosehip oil instead of this. I'm just not a fan of added fragrance, especially if it smells like OLD LADY.\n",
            "I used a Berts Bees belly butter DAILY during my pregnancy trying to prevent stretch marks and it didn't work! It wasn't until about 7 months post partum I decided to give Bio Oil a try on my C-section scar and stretch marks. Within one week there was already a noticable difference!!! Even my doctor who I've been seeing every other week noticed my scar was lighter in color!!!I love the light scent this has, it soaks in quickly and gentle on my sensitive skin.I highly recommend Bio Oil for new and old scars!\n",
            "I couldn’t really see full results because i stopped using it. I was recommended to use this for old acne scars on my face. My skin is not all that sensitive and definitely is not prone to break outs. I havent had a pimple in years. Applied a very small small amount to my face and within a week i was broke out. It clogged up my pores terribly. May work for you but ill try other products for that purpose. The smell is a very floral “grandma” smell. Im really not crazy about it.\n",
            "I’m in my fifties and olive skinned. This product has helped my skin look better. I use it twice a day - under my makeup in the morning and before bedtime. My eyes felt a burning sensation and were watery during the first 2-3 weeks. That reaction went away. It is not painful. I continued to use in spite of my reaction to the oil because the product is not cheap. I’m glad I continued to use it. I’m on my 3rd bottle. I had a few sun spots on my cheeks that got lighter. I gifted one to my sister. I love this product and highly recommend it. It does not have a scent.\n",
            "(Update below) I honestly can’t believe this. I’ve been using this once or twice a day for only three days and my stretch marks that were pretty deep and dark have already lightened up SO much. I didn’t think I’d be seeing results this fast. I’m swearing by this stuff now.UPDATE!! I stand by what I said before, you do have to keep using the product though which I’m okay with BUT I have spells or dry scalp issues every now and then, usually during the fall when the air is dryer than I’m used to. I usually just let it go away on its own but I have a hair appointment in two days so I didn’t know what to do, I’ve tried coconut oil, a special 25$ shampoo that works okay, even eczema lotion when I got desperate one time. I sectioned my hair carefully to be sure my entire scalp was covered in bio oil, wrapped it up, slept and showered the next day being sure to do a thorough but gentle scrub and good rinse and what. Do. You. Know. My scalp is completely clean and looks perfect. Even when my scalp isn’t dry I don’t think I’ve ever seen it this healthy looking.\n",
            "I am pleased to say I had GREAT results using the product.I had scarring from years of picking ingrown hairs on my beard area, scars on my legs from hiking through bushesand just a few subtle things I saw could use improvement. My results exceeded my expectations. It not only changed the appearance of skins texture, but it faded 75% of the scarring that was plagued my face and body. I usually will put it on my face , neck at night before bed (after washing my face), and its AMAZING on the body right after a shower while still damp. I cant say enough good things about this product. I know results may vary, but I have most favorable results with this one. It is now a household standard.\n",
            "I’ve purchased this product at the drug store and was running low so I had to restock on it. I noticed it was a bit cheaper on Amazon than in the store by a few dollars, which drove me more on purchasing it on here. However, I was a bit hesitant as the reviews were claiming they received a damaged or replica item. I went ahead and purchased it anyway and I was very much pleased with the product. It is in fact an authentic item and the packaging and ingredients, even the scent are identical to the one I purchased in store. So don’t let the reviews drive you away from purchasing. I believe the product changed it’s design.\n"

            "I’ve used this for years!!! I can’t say enough about it! My skin hates everything! This product NEVER upsets my super sensitive face! I can use this when I have allergic reactions and it’s still gentle! It’s hydrating AF and sinks into the skin and absorbs like nobody’s business! I sleep with it overnight if my skins aggravated and it calms down redness and itching. Love this!!! Worth every penny!!! Will always buy this product! It’s a staple and I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone with dry and/or sensitive skin. Works on eczema and dry patches! It’s my all time favorite!\n",
            "LOVE BIO OIL! I have used this oil since the day I became pregnant with my second child, and I refuse to use anything else! I had emergency gall bladder removal at 26 weeks pregnant, and as you can see in my attached photo, the scars are healing tremendously well! I definitely feel the bio oil has improved the healing and scarring!In addition, I am 34 weeks pregnant in the photo, and while I do have stretch marks (white and shiny, old) that are from my previous pregnancy, I STILL have not gotten a single new stretch mark (as I write this review I am now 36weeks + 2days) and bio oil is truly the secret!The oil has a pleasant fragrance, soothes dryness and itchiness, and has sped up the healing from my surgery and reduced scarring. I will always highly recommend this to all my preggo mommy friends!\n",
            "I use this stuff in my regimen to prevent stretch marks in my pregnancies. I use it side by side with a handful of other products (burt’s bees mama bee oil & lotion, palmer’s lotion and vitamin E oil) and haven’t gotten stretch marks on my belly even though I’m genetically predisposed to stretch marks and have them on my thighs and boobs. I’m so happy it’s helped prevent stretch marks on my stomach throughout pregnancy! Started using at about 14 weeks.\n",
            "So I’m using this for pregnancy. So far I have gotten stretch marks all over my body except for my tummy. But I still have 2 months to go so I will probably come back and update. I’ve heard people say that sometimes they appear the last weeks of pregnancy so I’m still expecting some. But I definitely recommend this for any! I even used this on my skin to prevent wrinkles.Update: I’m currently two months postpartum right now and don’t have any stretch marks on my belly. I did forget to apply it after two weeks postpartum and got two very small stretch marks. So basically I got stretch marks everywhere where I didn’t apply the oil and none on my stomach lol\n",
            "Bought this while pregnant because everybody raves about it but I’m almost through the entire bottle and I have not seen a difference in the appearance of the stretch marks I already have and a few new ones crept up while I’ve been using it as well. On top of that, this stuff gets on everything! I have had to use dawn soap to get stains out of clothes from this stuff and it takes so long to dry! Don’t recommend this one.\n",
            "I use this so much! I used it during pregnancy some years ago, but I ordered some to try to help with some dry patches/maskne after the mask mandates. And it totally helped! I even started dabbing some at my smile lines around my eyes and it softens them and gives a youthful glow. I have very sensitive skin and have never had a problem with it\n",
            "I love this stuff. I only use it on uneven skin tones. I am top-heavy and my shoulder straps tend to take it to the skin and cause discoloration. Every morning I put this stuff on those particular areas and they keep my skin tone even. You can tell the difference when you don’t use it as opposed to what you do. It is a great product to use to even your skin tone.\n",
            "This is two days apart! I recently gained a lot of weight very suddenly and was recommended to try this. In only TWO days my stretch marks have gone from a dark dark red/purple to a lighter pink. I can only imagine what they will look like a month from now! Not to mention, my skin has been soooooooo soft.\n",
            "Oh my gosh! I have weird combination skin that pours oil just at the thought of moisturizer. Not to mention that I work in a physically active job so I’m already sweating throughout the day. That being said, I was super skeptical about using an oil anywhere near my face but I had heard good reviews and decided to give it a try. Holy cow! I can’t attest to its use for scars as I haven’t been using it that long but it definitely works as a moisturizer! My skin hasn’t felt this soft and I haven’t gone this long without dry flakes in forever! I use three drops on a cotton ball morning and night after I wash my face and it’s enough to cover my whole face and neck area. I only use foundation for makeup and was super shocked to find that there is absolutely no sheen when I apply it over the oil, and I have noticed an overall lowered oil production level throughout the day!The smell is a little strong but I don’t find it to be a horrible scent and it fades after a few minutes\n",

Even with hyaluronic acid which is supposed to hydrate skin.  Bio-Oil has worked wonderfully and has helped with scars. I use twice a day. Mostly on my face.  My Bio-Oil bottle did not look like the other bottles that people claimed were fake. It has a very light smell. I have clogged hair follicles and therefore really dry bumps.  Was using a prescription medication.  I no longer have to.  Bio-Oil has taken care of the problem just after three days,  twice a day.  I can't say enough good things about it.  As long as it's available it will be a daily part of my routine.\n",
            "The first photo is from Sept. 8, and the second one is Oct. 9. In just one month this stuff has made more progress than anything I’ve ever used. I had terrible scarring from acne caused by an IUD. Finally got it removed and acne went away, but I was left with the scarring. This stuff is a lifesaver. I put it on under my moisturizer in the morning and before I go to bed. My skin looks much brighter and more even. Can’t wait to see the results 6 months from now!\n",
            "I had two surgeries at the beginning of August. My scars healed really well, but they have been a dark purple ever since. They look really bruised. I bought this on January 4, 2021 today is January 20,2021 they have already faded to a lighter purple and are less noticeable. It’s working really well! I have been using the oil on some stretch marks as well, it doesn’t seem to have had the same extreme effect, but I am hopeful. Definitely purchase if you have dark scars. The smell is t great, but it’s not horrible either.\n",
            "Wow! This Bio-Oil is awesome! From the moment I put it on, I could almost hear my skin say \"Thank You!\" My face & skin hasn't felt this soft in such a long time! I've only used it for three days now but my skin is loving it! Would recommend it everyone who's looking for a great product!I will update later on how well it helps with diminishing the scars I have but until then, I'm just going to enjoy the way it has already softened my skin!\n",
            "Bio Oil sounds like an appealing and 'natural' way to reduce a scar on my leg, with different oils, but had I noticed the lisiting for Fragrance (parfum) I would NOT have purchased it.  I've been applying it as instructed for about 3 weeks, and it has lightened the scar just enough that I am optimistic; you supposedly don't see full results for 3 months.  But I cannot stand the stink of it, and I am growing to dislike it more with use.  So if, like me, you are affected by too much fragrance (which, by the way, is chemical and unhealthy, I enjoy products that are scented from botanicals) I would not recommend trying Bio-Oil.  Why so many otherwise good products are over-scented is a mystery, I struggle to find good curly hair conditioners and stying products, and I know from various reviews and speaking with people that intolerance of chemical smells is on the rise.  Gentle botanical scents have a much better affect on your nervous system.  Enough perfume!!\n",
            "Whew...this oil is amazing. I put it on all over as soon as I turn off the shower while still in the tub.  I stand there for a moment to let it absorb, then put on my fluffiest, terry cloth robe and sit for a few minutes with a hot cup of tea. Heaven. Once absorbed, your skin will feel like velvet...for a few days, too, even after a few showers without reapplying.  This oil is pure luxury so get it and pamper yourself like you deserve. I give it as gifts and get rave reviews. Trust me.  You’ll agree.  Not sticky at all and absorbs quickly.\n",
            "So I LOVE this! It rubs on nice and I feel like I dont have to wait too long to pull my pants up over my stomach after applying. Also to scent isn't overwhelming or strong which is great! Been using it for almost 2 months now and still not sick of the smell! But with that said I don't believe I'll buy another bottle bc it doesn't have a pump. Its super inconvenient to have to squirt it out especially if I'm going back for more...If they updated this product with a pump it would be the best. I may repurchase it if the one I got my last two pregnancy is still out of stock (which is why I bought this one in the first place lol) but not sure bc it really does bug me not having a pump. And yes I knew it didn't have a pump when I bought it but didn't think it would be that annoying not to have it.\n",
            "It's very oily. Wherever it's applied, make sure no other things touches it as otherwise it could stain it. I was hoping it has no smell but it smells like perfume. If you like it, good. The reason I bought it was for my recovery cold sore which leaves a patch of redness on my lips. After using it for a couple of weeks, I don't see much improvement at all. Maybe it's just me but at this point, I'm not really convinced.\n",
            "Although I only use it once every night even though it says to use twice. I just rather not be oily twice a day. Still i feel it doesn't hydrate my skin at all. Worked better with a combination of the Burts Bee Momma Butter. The bottle also says that the oil is suppose to be super absorbent but i cant really confirm that since i do it right before bed i'm not sure if it absorbs into my skin or my clothes and blankets. Either way my skin still feels like it wants to tear. I did how ever notice that it helped heal an old gone bad belly button piercing scar. As for my stretch marks from growing up are all still noticeable. Didn't trust it alone to prevent my belly stretch marks thats why i started using the Momma Butter\n",
            "As a first time buyer and the seeing all the reviews claiming this is not genuine BioOil, can only go on personal opinion.This does smell odd for a “natural” product. Reminiscent of Ban du Soliel suntan oil, but sweeter flowery version.I’m not a fan of scented stuff and saw no change in skin, even after applying. After 3rd try, it went in the trash.\n"

On the package, mineral oil is the main ingredient, and I do not like mineral oil. It’s marketed as a herbal oil with plants so it’s very dishonest and misleading to put an ingredient list that is not exactly like the ingredients on the package.\n",
            "This is  a quick absorbing oil with a light, pleasant scent that doesn't linger.  I had high hopes for this as the reviews paint this as something magical.  I had a minor surgery about six months before I bought this and was hoping this would help my scar go away/look less noticeable.  I've been using this for almost a year and my scar looks pretty much the same as it did before.  As I said, I started this about six months after so not sure if it would have made a bigger difference if I started earlier, but for me it hasn't made any difference.\n",
            "Great product. I have acne scars and very dry ankles/elbows... this stuff really hydrates all areas while not overwhelming already oilier areas. I can use this on my face in the t-zone on some deep acne scars and not get a breakout. I also use this in my hair on my scalp to hydrate and help with seasonal climate changes. Its an instant itchy scalp fix, and the scent is gentle but lovely! My boyfriend uses it on the ends of his long hair to help prevent split ends.This is a great oil.Also, you cant find a better price yet on this anywhere else. Ulta is in the 20's and target is around 15 to 18 dollars depending on your area. Order now, this 4.2 ounce large bottle is almost a steal for the benefits this product delivers.\n",
            "This stuff is amazing. I have really sensitive skin and after having my baby my knees took a huge beating. They got these gross calluses on them “housewife knees” and dude I tried everything even polishing them off with a foot exfoliater. I bought this for my face but decided to try on my knees and two days later I realized I didn’t have calluses anymore. Crazy amazing and it smells great.\n",
            "This product is something I can’t live without. The way it moistures and brightens my skin is unbelievable. I have noticed that during winter when I use products around this price range or lower my skin will feel so dry by the end of the day and I’ll need to add more. This is not the case with this oil. It lasts until the next time I shower. I also used to have marks on legs below my knees from how dry my skin used to be. This oil toned them and made them go away. I like it’s smell, but my mom doesn’t so I think it’s not a smell everyone can agree on. It’s not too strong anyway.\n",
            "I bought this to prevent and help heal my stretch marks, but a lot seems off. I use the smallest amount, and it’s still INCREDIBLY oily and never sinks into the skin, and i normally use a regular body oil as a moisturizer. It made me break out in a HORRIBLE rash on ALL of my stretch marks for weeks, even after stopping use it remained and I had to use prescription steroids to make it go away.  I do not have sensitive skin at all and this was the worst reaction ive ever seen! Ive seen reviews that this product is fake, so im going to assume mine was, since it did absolutely nothing but cause me pain and itching. Im going to buy straight from Target for comparison.\n",
            "I wish I had read more reviews for this...what I received was a fake. There wasn't any documentation in the box, no seal on the bottle, it's very runny and smells funny. So disappointing!\n",
            "I used Bio-Oil from my second trimester onward in both of my pregnancies, and it really helps with itching from skin stretching. I did not have stretch marks either time, but I have no idea how much of that is genetic and how much is product. Either way, it’s easy to apply, absorbs pretty quickly, the scent is mild and when I rub the excess onto my knuckles it helps prevent cracks and tears from winter skin—a little goes a long way! This is not a product you need to slather on to get the benefits. I will continue to use Bio-Oil at least during pregnancies and winter. One thing to note, the packaging has changed and with other products that can indicate a quality change, not so with Bio-Oil, the quality is consistently high.\n",
            "I have an allergy to gnats, no-see-ums or midges, and when they bite me (all teeth as you can barely see them, ha!), my skin becomes immediately irritated. I try hard to not scratch, but boy is it hard. Thus, I have scars all over my feet and lower legs. This oil, applied daily, for 1 week, actually started to improve the look of my scars. I use it every day. I still have scars, as they will never go away unless I have lazer, but they do seem to be better. I can at least wear shorts again. Plus, the smell is pleasant, too.\n",
            "I really liked this for the smell and consistency. I had high hopes as I saw a lot of celebrities and youtubers swearing by bio oil. However, it didn’t prevent stretch marks from happening for me as my breasts ballooned at the start of my pregnancy. I will now be using raw Shea butter as I should’ve been doing from the start and maybe mixing some of this oil in with it. But I likely won’t purchase again.\n",

I am grateful for the impact it had on my skin that it was able to come back to normal quickly. I actually applied it all over body. Even my husband noticed that my skin is extra soft and silky. You just have to be persistent in effect will be great. Regardless whether it’s genetic or the effect of the oil, the skin transformation during pregnancy., The fact that the overall effect on body was wonderful makes me very happy.\n",
            "Recently bought this as I am pregnant want to mitigate the scars and stretch marks as much as possible.I love how this feels. It’s definitely moisturizing and leaves my skin so soft, moisturized, and glistening. While it’s oil, I wouldn’t say it leaves me feeling “oily”. It doesn’t leave me feeling wet or gross. Just very moisturized and soft. Love the feel and love how it definitely makes a difference on my skin.I’ve been using it on my scars from previous scrapes or surgeries and it’s definitely reducing the darkness of them as well.\n",
            "I have gotten large stretch marks from the sudden quarantine weight gain. They were a deep purple and I was very self conscious.I noticed a change in color when I used it every day. Now I use it as often as I can (I don't always use it twice a day every day as instructed) but I can still see a difference and a little goes a long way. I was using it all over the area at first, but now I just apple on the stretch marks with my finger tip.\n",
            "I get more and bigger scars from this product. I didn’t know that it is very oily which caused my face to break out. I bought it to help the scars from the white/black heads on my forehead but I didn’t  see any changes. I do not recommend this product to people who get acne from oily skin. It will make it worse.\n",
            "I applied this the my belly while pregnant and it made my skin feel like it was burning. Maybe it prevents stretch marks, but anything that made my skin feel like that I figured might not be good for the baby and I stopped using. I moved on to Burt’s Bees Belly Butter. It felt great on my skin. I gained 49 lbs and not a single stretch mark during my pregnancy. I would recommend that product any day over this bio oil!\n",
            "This is wonderful to keep skin moisturized  I even used it at night time but as for the fact of getting rid of dark spots - no - that didn’t happen\n",
            "I cant stress this enough this product is the best one that I bought off of Amazon yet. I totally see the difference in 2 weeks. My  Acne scars that I had on my face is starting to fade away,  Since I have dry skin this product helps me with that by a lot. I haven't tried it on my stretch marks yet but I'm waiting for the bigger bottle to come in. Listen everyone that is about to buy this amazing product  you NEED the bigger bottle. I am a customer for life.\n",
            "I started using this product every other day from the week I found out I was pregnant. Now at 34 weeks, I have made it almost all the way through with no stretch marks! Full disclosure, I also have made it a priority to drink tons of water each day. I will continue to use this product even after I give birth and have just started using it on the dark spots on my face. It dries quickly, and a little goes a long way. I think the price is very reasonable for the results I've seen.\n",
            "I love this stuff so much and am so grateful the seller offers it at such a reasonable price. CVS sells it for 4x as much so to be able to get such a great product at a much lower price is appreciated! This product is great if you're looking for an everyday serum that won't make you breakout. It's super hydrating and is great to apply before bed, before your night cream or evening moisturizer. I've used similar serums before which lead me to break out and my skin doesn't feel as smooth. This product is very oily so you only need a little bit to go a very long way. It's also great after a day of being in the sun - overall I really feel like I'm taking great care of my skin with this product!\n"

He has sensitive skin and his skin takes to this just fine.He's 14 months and had a fall causing a big scar on his nose. Doc said it'll take up to a year to fully heal and natural oils are great for scars. So we'll see a year from now how it looks.Note: I let the scab heal first before using this product.I use it daily to aid the healing process. His pink scar seems to be fading faster than I expected. So far so good.\n",
            "I really like this oil for my skin and it helps my dry skin.  A family member of mine recently had some minor surgery and when the cut was healed use this oil to help remove the scar, she loves the stuff and it seems to be working well for her.  I also use it on my light scars from bug bites and I do see improvements.  This has to be the 10th bottle I have bought now it has been years.  It has a very interesting smell, I can't pinpoint it, but I like it.  I normally do not like putting oils on myself, but this one is an exception, it feels good and seems to sink into the skin faster.  I don't feel like a grease ball after using it.  I will continue to buy!\n",
            "I rarely leave reviews because who got time for that anyway?However, this oil IS a life changer. It tremendously improved my skin in my chest area. The oil gives it a glow I never experienced before.I started seeing results after a week and a half. I had acne on my chest and shoulders which completely disappeared. Now, the oil is taking care of the scars left. I know that this will take a bit longer however the results are very encouraging. So I would definitely say that it's meant for sensitive skin.I will update this review as I am not trying it on my face and on my thighs.\n",
            "I use this stuff ALL OVER my body. It's great- it's lightweight so I don't feel like I just took a bath in a deep fryer. I can use it on my face without worrying about breaking out (like I often do when using coconut oil), and it leaves my skin soft and glowing. It keeps my hands hydrated at work so I don't have to moisturize 50 times in a day. The smell is a little more floral than I'd like, but it's not overwhelmingly strong so I don't really notice it too much. It sinks in fast so I don't leave greasy fingerprints everywhere. I can't stress enough how great this stuff is.\n",
            "I would bathe in this stuff if I could! It’s amazing! I noticed some really bad stretch marks on my underarms after losing a little weight oddly enough. I’ve been using bio-oil for a few weeks now, twice a day, and I’m already seeing improvements. It’s also taken care of the horrible razor burn and irritation I’ve gotten on my underarms ever since I started shaving. I have always had incredibly sensitive skin, and this hasn’t given me any issues. I’m not crazy about the scent, but it’s not offensive, but not what I would prefer. I will definitely be buying more when I run out.\n",
            "I bought this originally because I wanted to fade some of my stretch marks and to help with dark spots. I have been using this for months now and it has not helped with either the reduction of scar/ stretch mark appearance nor the dark spots. I continued to use it and even purchased a second bottle because it’s a good moisturizer. It smells good and it leaves my skin nice and smooth. I would not give it five stars because it did not help with anything it advertises it would do for the reasons I originally purchased it for.\n",
            "I was scared of the \"this is fake\" reviews so I bought one in store from Target, and one from Amazon. Both had the same smell, texture, color, etc. So from my experience, this listing is legit.To review how it works, I used it every night while I was pregnant with twins. My family history was one of no stretch marks during pregnancy, so that probably helped me, but I also think this product was beneficial. I made it to the bump size of a full term single pregnancy before stretch marks appeared. When they did appear, they were white. I had a few marks appear on my sides at the end of my pregnancy, where I had not been applying nightly oil and those appeared dark and purple.  So I attribute the bump stretch marks being white and much less noticeable to the use of the oil. I thought it smelled really nice and fresh and absorbed decently well. I didn't like using it under my real clothes though because some does transfer to the fabric.\n",
            "I've been using this oil for maybe 4 or 5 days and I already see a huge difference in my facial scars and my belly stretch marks. I use it twice a day, once in the morning, and during my before bed routine. The smell isn't overpowering and a few drops goes a long way. Too much and it'll make your skin feel too greasy and heavy. I have extremely sensitive skin and this oil does not cause me to have any type of reaction to it. It leaves my skin feeling moisturized and soft all day. I will definitely buy more when I get low.\n",
            "I love this stuff so far. Using it since about 16 wks on my preggo belly at night time. Skin feels hyrdrated still when I wake up. I’ve barley used 1/2 a bottle and am currently 30weeks. Might start using elsewhere now that I know a little goes a long way. Somewhat grease upon initial application  but gets better once all rubbed in. Not really a scent to it which is fine with me since I am only using it at night.\n",
            "I really love bio oil and how it soaks into your skin not leaving it greasy. I have seen amazing things with this. My girlfriend has used it for years! She had deep stretch marks and discoloration in her face. I have seen a difference for sure! I started using it about a week ago. I have extremely sensitive dry skin. This doesn’t burn or irate my skin at all. Smells nice! Not over powering. Helped toned down my redness. Haven’t used it long enough to see if my stretch marks are better. I’ll update in a few months about that.\n",

            "Application is much more convenient than lotions or thicker products. The smell is AMAZING. I've been using this twice a day since towards the end of my 1st trimester (about a month into my 3rd now) & not a single stretch mark anywhere! Even my doctor complimented me on how great my skin has been . Would work well for anyone. My skin is very sensitive, even most \"sensitive\" & non scented 'natural' laundry soaps make me break out, but this stuff hasnt given me a problem ever. I love it.\n",
            "I really like the way it absorbs. I will probably use this until a few months after my pregnancy mainly because it feels really good on my sensitive,  stretching skin. .. the only downside is it smells terrible! It smells like old parfum blended inbaby oil. I would suggest also using a good body butter about 30 min. after applying.  This oil absorbs alot.. but this is what I need. Its important to moisturize all the layers of skin durring pregnancy\n",
            "I highly recommend this product, I struggled with acne in a certain area of my body & I tried everything and anything to get ride of it & the scares for a very long time. Not even a dermatologist could help with me. I used it everyday after the shower for about a few months and it worked amazing, all scars gone. My acne completely gone & never came back. That was 6 years ago, I still use it to this day forward just for stretch marks now, but I stopped using this product for a little bit and the acne didn’t return! So totally worth buying it! Small bottle can be found at a local store but not the big bottle, buying the big bottle on here is better and saves you money. The big bottle last for a long time.\n",
            "I have Sjogren’s which is an autoimmune disorder making my skin extremely dry. I used this on my face as soon as I received it and ohhhh, the scent is absolutely wonderful! It is an oil, so at first there is an oily feel and sheen. Then after a bit, it totally absorbed into my skin making it feel very soft and smooth. I’m not as concerned about scars or discoloration but if it helps reduce the brown spots from hormones, I would consider it a bonus!! It does what I ordered it for... purely moisturizing my super dry skin. Awesome 😊\n",
            "Love bio oil. Use it for my face as it’s a non comedogenic (it doesn’t clog pore & cause breakouts) provides the extra moisturizer you need in a face oil. Will put it on after my lotion layer. Also works great on body with scars & stretch marks as I’ve used it in the passed to fade my transplant scar across my belly.\n",
            "Smells nice, like medicine. Arrived in Good condition. Tested it out on my skin and it was Oil, not watered down or tampered with.It clearly says “in the unlikely event of skin irritation, discontinue use” FYI so Ignore the negative reviews about skin outbreaks. Read instructions and ingredients first.Anyway, I will give update about if it works and with results within the next 3 months.\n",
            "WIth my first pregnancy, I started using this product as early as my first trimester. I used this product every day after showering and am stretch mark free on my belly. My mother didn't get stretch marks when she was pregnant with me and my brothers so I also credit having good genes as to why I'm not as prone to them. Bio-Oil has a great scent to it and I noticed that it does help with uneven skin tone. My 1yr old son has a bit of eczema on his foot and after rubbing a little bit of this oil on the affected site after his bath, I noticed a big difference in the morning. I am currently pregnant with my second and am continuing to use this product again. I'm almost done with my 2nd bottle 16.7 ounce bottle and am about 24 weeks pregnant as we speak! Especially with the dry summers, the oil helps to hydrate my skin. I would highly recommend this product to expecting mothers.\n",
            "I started using this about half way through my pregnancy and it’s been about a week & a half since I got it. I have used it every day since then and had previous stretch marks from my last pregnancy 5 years ago and began getting more this time around. The marks are fading SO FAST including my old ones and I love the smell. I even started using it on my face and have noticed a more even skin tone already! Will be purchasing again! LOVE IT!\n",
            "I've been using Bio Oil for a while now and it is the only thing that I noticed actually diminish my scars and made me skin look and feel great. (I use it with Aveeno lotion). It does have a light smell that I like, isn't too oily and soaks into the skin instead of just sitting on top of it. It says on its own instructions to use twice a day, I only put it on after a shower (while my skin is still warm) so it'll soak into my pores of my skin. It took away stretch marks  on my hips and shoulders and diminished scars on my legs, also helped with overall appearance and softness and smoothness of my skin!!\n",
            "This scent smells amazing! I was skeptical about this product. I’ve heard from others that it works, but I just didn’t believe it. I suffer from HS and have scarring as a result, especially under my arms. I refuse to wear sleeveless shirts because of my insecurities, but now I’m ready for the summer! Bring the sleeveless shirts and dresses on! I’ve been using this product for only a few weeks. I apply it 2x’s a day and have seen great improvements with my scarring. It’s a great moisturizer and is great for anyone with sensitive skin.\n"

I can't stand perfume. I love essential oils so its not the scent - its that it is clearly a chemical perfume. I also happen to know how bad they are for you to wear chemical fragrance. SO I think I'll give up and go to a plain organic oil.\n",
            "I tend to pick at my skin, especially on my face, if I have a pimple or blemish. I read online that Bio-Oil heals small wounds quickly so I thought it might help me. It is absolutely perfect for what I need. I apply it once or twice a day when needed (using a cotton pad) and it heals my skin sooo quickly without causing clogged pores or acne.I didn’t find it as fast-absorbing as others but I don’t mind and actually find that having a thin layer or this on my skin keeps me from touching the area. Would definitely recommend!\n",
            "See photos.... within 2 days of using this product my hyperpigmentation caused by intense TCA 25 % peel , started to peel off my skin. I have posted photos to prove that... 2 days!! Hyperpigmentation takes months of rigorous skin care protocol to lighten. Sunscreen is a MUST... never skip the sunscreen.. the sun darken the skin.. you are riding a hamster wheel if you skip sunscreen. Where it everyday for the rest of your life. Include your chest and hands. This is a miracle product! But not without : SUNSCREEN\n",
            "I purchased this as soon as I found out I was pregnant to help with stretch marks. I started using this product in the second trimester as instructed. I used this in conjunction with a stretch mark cream by Medela and didn't develop any stretch marks until around 30 weeks. They say stretch marks are mostly due to genetics, so I can't say I blame this for getting them. Even after developing stretch marks, this does help some with the itchiness due to my skin stretching. I'm on my second bottle now. While I can't say it completely prevents stretch marks, I do feel that it does help some with the appearance of them. The only down side is that this does have a slight scent. It doesn't bother me but it's definitely noticeable. It also takes a little bit of time or a lot of rubbing to fully absorb, so it's not something you can quickly slap on and go.\n",

            "39 weeks pregnant and amazing results! Absolutely recommend.Update pictures 6 weeks pregnant and 38, my pregnancy ended at almost 41.All the women of my family have a ton of stretch marks ( I mean A LOT) and I was trying to fight the genetic 😁.3 weeks POSTPARTUM  AND NO STRETCH MARKS AT ALL!!!!!I used BIO OIL every morning since I find out I was pregnant ( a gooood amount) and at night-Organic Shea Butter by Sky Organics-. And drinking a lot of water.After delivery I continued doing it and I will until my body goes back 100%.So happy with the results\n",
            "This oil works! I use it on my face and body everyday. It lightened my stretched mark and scars! I used it on my arms and it also lightened my tan line! I put some on my face too after lotion and my face is brighter and a lot of my dark spots faded too! Absolutely love it!\n",
            "I've been using this my whole pregnancy, 39 weeks with no stretch marks. Could be genetics as people say but I have stretch marks on my butt and thighs from HS growth spurt. I will say this oil does nothing for old stretch marks.  If you can get it from SAMS you'll get a much better price but we don't have a Sam's near us, just Costco who doesn't carry this anymore.\n",
            "Some reviews say that this isn’t the original product or that it’s a knock off but the product I got seems to be the real deal and works well! I have acne scars on my chest that I want to reduce and eventually remove and this oil has been a great start! I use it on my face as well! It smells really good too. At first I wasn’t too sure about the smell just because smelling it out of the bottle I couldn’t quite put my finger on what the scent was but when you apply it it smells wonderful. I use it as a moisturizer as well and it works well for rough and bumpy skin on my arms. Well worth the price and a tiny bit of the oil goes a long way!\n",

            "As a nurse in surgery, I see a lot of incisions and skin wounds.  A plastic surgeon recommended bio oil to a friend with scars and we tried it.  People with dark complexion and blended skin tones this could help.  My daughter scars easily making a change to the brown pigment.  A stick scratched her while playing in the yard and over a year later it looks like she has used brown marker on herself.  It takes several weeks to see it fade but worth it.  I don’t know if the scar will completely be gone or come back when she gets a little sun.\n",
            "Bio- oil ? Are you kidding me?  This oil isn't even made with ANY kind of biologic oil. It's made with Mineral oil !GLARING PROBLEM ! I'm not surprised that it did absolutely no good whatsoever.\n",
            "Not sure why this product has to have all the chemicals and preservatives listed on the box?It’s a nice combination of oils - but there is a multitude of chemicals - fragrance and red dye too.The choice is yours - my question is why the fragrance and why the dye and chemicals?\n",
            "So I’ve only been using this for about a week on my tummy (14 months postpartum, lost 80 pounds, stretch marks and sagging skin) and I swear I’ve already noticed a difference. It’s thin like oil (obviously) but it sticks like lotion and it’s amazing. It’s smell is similar to shaving cream which I personally really like. It does leave your hands a little oily even after rubbing in but I don’t mind washing my hands after. Definitely worth the money so far since it’s the only thing I’ve used that even has kind of made a difference.\n",
            "I had heard great things about this oil for reducing and preventing stretch marks during pregnancy.  I added it to my subscribe and save order after running out of a different kind of belly butter.  After 2 days of use (morning and evening) I broke out in a horrible itchy/painful rash over my belly and hips where I had been using it.  My skin is still irritated and red/bumpy/itchy over a day later, after discontinuing use.  While it may work for some, there must have been something in it that didn't agree with my skin.  I'm now stuck with the rest of the bottle and no use for it.\n",
            "So I’ve been using this oil daily on my breasts and my belly during my pregnancy. On those areas I have not even ONE stretch mark. My skin looks great. But on the side/back of my hips I have a few little ones, though I know I haven’t applied it at all there as I didn’t think of it. My conclusion is that this product has prevented a lot of stretch marks on my skin! Love it! Bought it more to see now if it will do anything to the ones i got where i didn’t apply before and update this review in the future.\n",
            "Compré este aceite porque pensé que me iba a ayudar a que no me salieran estrías en el embarazo pero no funcionó. Igual me salieron estrías por mucho que me colocaba el aceite todos los días. El aceite tiene buena fragancia pero en mi opinión si lo compras para que te ayude a disminuir la apariencia de tus estrías o que te ayude a que no te salgan, no vale la pena. O al menos no para mi. Si lo compras porque te gusta hidratar tu piel con aceites y piensas que esto te puede ayudar, bien.\n",
            "Seriously can’t rave enough about this oil. Soaks in well, great scent, and does amazing thing for skin. I moved to the Midwest from the South and started developing stretch marks in the winter due to the dry air. This makes my skin feel great and reduced the appearance of the marks I hard and reversed the marks that were red and starting. Recommended this to someone who was pregnant, she used it and no belly stretch marks! Take it easy on the face as too much can make you break out, but for whatever reason you’re thinking you want to buy this product and try it, it’s worth it. You will thank yourself later.\n",
            "De verdad funciona y se nota en las pocas semanas ... lo único que cuando lo dejas de usar se empiezan a marcar otra vez aunq ya no como al principio pero aún se notan\n",
            "I honestly could cry. I gain a lot of weight cause I was struggling with the news of my mom getting cancer and in the process I got stretch marks. This stuff started showing results just after the first time using it. I have gained so much confidence back seeing my stretch marks disappear during my weight loss journey. I also use a derma roller after I apply which I think helps a lot. I highly recommend this product for anyone who wants to get rid of stretch marks\n"

Not only is it good to prevent stretch marks (I used everyday in pregnancy and didn’t get any). It’s also great for razor burn- I put on my legs after shaving and don’t get the itchy bumps like usual. I also use it on my face. Light scent that’s not overpowering and it’s not super oily like coconut oil. So happy I found this!\n",
            "Works great for stretch marks. I used during pregnancy to prevent stretch marks and didn’t have a single one (and I’m prone to them- I have them from puberty).Only con is that the oil does take a while to soak in and can stain clothes\n",
            "I have only used it once and I love the scent and feel of the oil. It also absorbs into the skin pretty quickly and doesn't leave the skin feeling sticky, just soft and moisturized. I got it to help with uneven skin tones, scars, and stretch marks so I obviously don't have any results for that but I will come back at a later time to post my review for it diminishing marks on the body, I am taking pics to show progress.\n",
            "I bought this  after reading many reviews, and am very happy that I did. After having foot surgery my foot was extremely dried out and the incision areas looked just awful. I applied this to my foot and over the healed over incisions and it has worked wonders. I use it at least once a day, and also use on my other foot that was kind of dried out too. My healing foot I have also done Epson Salt soaks and that helped to initially remove a lot of dead skin. Both my feet look so much better. I recommend this product, and will most likely buy more when this bottle runs out to keep my feet looking supple and healthier.\n",
            "I got this oil to try for my husband's persistent seborrheic dermatitis.  Nothing we have tried has worked, consistently.  His outbreaks are so spontaneous, usually related to stress.  So it's a constant battle to keep him from looking like freak with all the redness and oily flaking. Usually takes 3-4 days to clear up with vitamin C serum, etc.Got the Bio-Oil.  Overnight success!  Finally we have a solution to the ongoing problem!  His sensitive skin seems to love the Oil.  So now I'm using it,too!  Will be helpful if it can help me circumvent all the expensive skin creams.Thank you, Bio-Oil, and all who wrote reviews here that convinced me to try it!\n",
            "The pros:  this stuff really works.  It has made my skin absolutely beautiful.  It has faded scars and stretchmarks, makes it super soft and silky, and it gives my skin a beautiful glow.  I have really noticed a huge difference.  The cons:  the smell.  I feel like it is overly-perfumed.  It's not necessarily a bad smell, and it goes away pretty quickly, especially once I put clothes on, but I don't think it needs to be as strongly scented as it is.  I would absolutely LOVE it if Bio-Oil came out with an unscented version.  But since it works so well, I will continue to use it every day.\n",
            "The reason I had purchased this product was because I have scars on my arm that I’ve been trying to get rid off. I used it as directed, it did help moisturize my skin, but I felt it was greasy, which I didn’t like (but I guess that’s kind of my fault for buying an oil of course it’s going to be oily) other than my skin looking more moisturized, I didn’t really see any other results, which is a bummer, but onto the next too find what will help with my skin.\n",
            "I've used this product before, and absolutely love it. I'd recommend this to anyone to help with scars or stretch marks. Not too oily; absorbs well into the skin, but I always put it on and leave it for a while and then rub it in again before putting clothes on. I've never had oil marks on my clothes doing it this way, or on my sheets if I put it on before bed. BUT, I don't lather it on thick, so I'm not sure what would happen if you did.\n",
            "Heads up for ingredient-conscious pregnant ladies: Bio-oil contains retinyl palmitate. I won't be using this during my pregnancy, and I'm pretty shocked at how heavily marketed it is toward pregnant women. While topical retinoids are not proven to cause birth defects the same as oral retinoids, doctors still routinely recommend that we avoid them entirely. Maybe save this for postpartum if you really want to use it.\n",
            "Bio oil is great, Zero stretch marks during pregnancy, and my belly was huge!Also I am currently treating my legs for varicose veins. Vein ablation and sclerotherapy.  And due to the treatment my legs started to show discoloration just where they treated the vein my doctor recommended to use bio oil to help with the discoloration.  I have noticed that they are getting better, but discoloration is still there. Hopefully it goes away very soon.\n",

Vitamin E also increases the moisture content of the epidermis, making the skin soft, smooth and supple.PurCellin Oil™: Reduces the thickness of the formulation, improving smoothness and ease of application, making Bio-Oil readily absorbed by the skin.

            "I'm 74 years old and have been using this for over a year......best night time moisturizer I have found!  I have multiple allergies and have sensitive skin.\n",
            "Bought this to rub on my teenager’s back. He’s growing and gaining weight and got stretch marks on his back. So far, they’re getting lighter sonI definitely see a difference.Also, I’ve been using this on my face as a moisturizer at night and it’s been doing wonders. I have sensitive skin and rosacea sonI can’t use just anything, but I thought why not try - and I love it! My face looks so much cleaner and smoother now!*What might work for me, might not work for others, so be cautious using this on your face.\n",
            "BUYER BEWARE!!!! I read a few negative reviews about this exact product before purchasing it but I didn’t listen and bought it anyway. I should have just bought it at Walmart like I always do but I didn’t want to expose myself due to COvid 19. Anyway, big mistake!! This product is counterfeit and used!! The bottle I received was all scratched up everywhere and the liquid was clearer than usual. I’m SURE this is fake bio oil and I’m returning it ASAP. DO NOT BUY!!!!\n",
            "I honestly usually don't post reviews, but by far this product went above and beyond my expectations. I noticed some unsightly red stretch marks a few months ago, and honestly stretch marks usually do not bother me, but months after they were still red and there. I didn't look into alternatives to help me get rid of them later until I wanted to go swimming. And to be honest I wasnt looking to spend that much money on them. This was an absolute bang for my buck. My stretch marks had dulled down to a deep red and within THREE DAYS the stretch marks had subsided back to my skin color and was on the verge of disappearing. Do not doubt this product. Although I may have been one of the few cases where the product took miraculously well, it could very well work really well for you too! I read a few reviews about how it smells bad but Its like an herbal scent that I dont really mind. Overall, the product delivered beyond my expectations especially considering what I paid for. i always thought treatment for stretch marks would be expensive and ineffective; this product has blown my mind.\n",
            "I regret not taking thé before and after pictures. But I have been using this product for I think 2-3 weeks and from week 1 I could tell a difference from the appearance of my stretch marks. I am African American  and I decided to use this oil as my lotion. It was just fine too. I think I will stick to this.Compared to all other stretch mark product I’ve used in th le past this one definitely works. I have the darker ( or purple ) stretch marks so those are kinda hard to go but this made my stretch marks to reduce and I feel more confident wearing some clothes that show off some skin.\n",
            "It moisturizes because of the rich mineral oil. It plugged my pores. It cause more pigmentation on skin. It has full of perfumes. It's not good for sensitive skins. It just a marketing wonder. I would not recommend this brand to anybody. Please, use your money for better products.\n",
            "One of my girlfriend spoke highly of this oil.  So I thought, \"what do I have to lose?\"  In my 2nd trimester of pregnancy, I started applying the oil morning and night.  I kept this regiment up all the way through to day my daughter was due.  I am very pleased with the results.  No stretch marks!  I definitely recommend this product for all soon to be moms out there.I still have some left over and will try it on my existing stretch marks to see how that does.  More comments to come...\n",
            "I love bio-oil but the package I received was sketchy so I am returning it. It has been opened and then resealed with clear tape. This is NOT okay for something I am putting on my body. No way to know if it is the right product or had been tampered with. It is suppose to be a NEW product, not used!!!\n"

            "I really wish I had taken before and after photos when I first started using this, but I have taken some now and I'll try to update later.  It really does help with scars. I've been using it on my face for a few months every night. I wasn't sure if it would work, but it was a great moisturizer. I have really bad breakouts on my right chin all the time with lots of discoloration. I wasn't expecting anything great, and it took a few months, but the difference is incredible. The discoloration is almost gone and it had been there for years. Don't know if it will work on raised scars or stretch marks but it's worth trying. Also, totally safe to use on your face.\n",
            "Someone recommended this so I ordered it and LOVE it!  It has a light scent that doesn't overpower and it doesn't leave you feeling oily or greasy.  I put it on my body after showering and my son just told me that he has used it on his face while showering and then lightly rinses it and likes it as well. It keeps my skin from feeling itchy in the MN winter.  I do put lotion on after drying before clothes, but this keeps me moisturized all day.\n",
            "FAKE!! I received my package and it was already opened but taped shut. Seriously? Do NOT BUY THIS. The original Bio-Oil is great but this is a S. C. A. M.\n",
            "When I first purchased I was concerned about what it was going to smell like after reading all the reviews saying it smelled horrible. First thing I did when I got it is smell it and it does NOT SMELL BAD. Seriously. I personally enjoy the subtle smell of lavender and chamomile. It literally smells like essential oils. If that’s not your preference then I guess don’t purchase. It doesn’t leave you looking super greasy but it does leave a very subtle glow and leaves my skin feeling  soft. I personally paired it with another cream for extra hydration. I will update after i’ve used it for a longer time to see if it works well alone.\n",
            "I bought it two months of my c section and have been using it for the past two months. But my stretch marks are still turning from pink to dark purple which is quite obvious on the belly. Perhaps I should continue to use it for another month but for now I really cannot see its effectiveness. It is quite greasy and I have to uncover my belly for about half an hour to let it dry. The only thing I like about it is the smell. Some reviewers complained about it but I actually like the light scent.\n",
            "This oil has been amazing for my stretch marks!! Their color and appearance has vastly improved since I began using it, and since then I have also noticed I have not gotten anymore on my belly and thighs. I’m in the third trimester of my first pregnancy, and I am so glad I was recommended this product! I have pupps rash, and I do believe this has helped since adding it to my skin care routine\n",
            "Bio-Oil is the BEST skin product on the market. I use it as a twice a day, morning and before i go to bed. Small lines have disappeared. My skin is very smooth and seems to glow. A doctor recommended this to one of my friends who told me about it. I have bought several bottles as gifts.. Be patient. It will take a few months for you to see notice the changes. Works well for Pregnant women help with stretch marks and scares I been use this product for over 4 years\n",
            "I wanted to like this soooooo badly, as it's worked for my mom and grandma for smoothing their skin. I have dry skin so I got excited to try it. It broke my chin out with rashy pimples 2 weeks into using it. Haven't been able to get rid of the rashy pimples yet (another 2 weeks later) and I even stopped using it. I must have extremely sensitive skin and I think it just clogged my pores perhaps. My mom and grandma would rate it a 5 though for anyone wanting to hear their opinion.\n",
            "Been using for about 4 months and have used it religiously for my first pregnancy. I started using before my stretch marks came in. When they did it was very minimally. However with my stomach being about 4ft around which is over double what it was it’s pretty inevitable that I’d get some sort of stretch marks. I use this product once to twice a day. Some days I’ve just used straight coconut oil which I have noticed doesn’t do anything but moisturize. Bio oil actually soothes my irritated skin and prevents future irritation while also repairing. I can absolutely see a difference between issuing coconut oil for a few days and than using bio oil ONCE even after a couple min! I will update with post later with a picture for reference. I am giving 4 stars because it doesn’t prevent stretch marks completely but I am very impressed with how well it’s helped in comparison to how big my stomach has grown. I highly recommend this product!\n",

            "First, I am usually a person that makes my own lotion to avoid cheap fillers. I am not a fan of mineral oil in moisturizer. This product does contain mineral oil. I make a little bit of an exception here, because this product goes on very smoothly, the scent is nice, and the oily residue is absorbed fairly quickly, comparative to similar products. It is too early to tell if it will have an effect on scars or not, but a little bit seems to go along way and I will continue to use.\n",
            "I LOVE THIS! I bought two different oils, when I ordered this. The other oil cane cracked and the packaging sucked. This product though, oh my lanta... it smells so good! I found it at my local drug store, so I purchase it there too!\n",
            "This is like my go to stretch mark oil. After 3 kids, I surprisingly did not have very many stretch marks at all but I still used this for the 3 deep stretch marks I had and it has made them fade. You can still notice them but I was not using it faithfully either. My kids are now 10, 4, and 3, and I still use this on occasion. I've been using it off and on for 10 years! And it smells so great!\n",
            "I know they say stretch marks are mainly genetics. Neither my mom nor sister developed stretch marks during pregnancy, however, they also weren’t pregnant with twins; unlike me! I used this stuff RELIGIOUSLY morning & night as soon as I found out I was pregnant up until I got back down to my pre-pregnancy weight. I did not develop a SINGLE stretch mark. Note that in the photo of me in the bikini was at about five months. I ended getting up to 172 and I was huge and honestly too embarrassed of my naked belly so I never photographed it, which I now regret. 2nd photo is post-pregnancy. Still some extra skin but NO stretch marks! While using this product I did break out very badly on my stomach with acne. But I think that’s a side effect I can live with given the results I ended up with\n",
            "Pros:- I bought the oil to use on my scars. I usually use mederma but it was getting to be very expensive because I was going through those small tubes of gel very quickly. This bottle is really lasting me a long time because I only need a few dabs of oil on my specific scars.- My scars have been actually fading. They’re not completely gone but I can tell that they are a lot harder to see than before.Cons:- The scent is a bit unique. It’s not overpowering but I think I can do without it.*For reference, I did not apply this to face. I only applied it to my legs and arms.\n",
            "Winter in Wisconsin is not kind to the skin. My legs get so dry and itchy but I put this on after a shower and they look and feel great. No more scratching my legs until they bleed! I also use this product on my face and it seems to even out the skintone. Has a nice smell too. Makes my skin feel so soft after it is absorbed into the skin. I ordered this product after seeing it on the Morning Show and Jenna Bush said she used the same for stretch marks.\n",
            "I’m certain this product isn’t real, or it’s been diluted. First all, it did not come with a safety seal. The bottles I purchased at CVS, Target and other retail stores come with a safety seal, and the smell is wonderful. However, this bottle lacks the same smell and consistency...it doesn’t feel as oily as my other bottles I’m used to. I will be returning this product and would not recommend getting it from Amazon.\n",
            "I am so in love. I am multi race woman (which I love ;) and get really dry skin in the winter, and on top of that I am 5 months pregnant!! I’ve been using this oil all over my body and my face since I’ve been 3 months pregnant and let me tell you!! The best! Being pregnant your skin can get very itchy as it’s stretching and this soothes and hydrates my skin like no other. I also put this on when my skin is dry and it absorbs perfectly leaving no oily residue after application.I am also very voluptuous and my current stretch marks and blotches have diminished significantly! Hands down my favorite oil and will continue to use even after my pregnancy.So grateful for you guys thank you!!\n",
            "Not a fan of the scent. In my opinion, it has an \"old lady\" type of smell to it. My husband even commented on it the first few times I used it. Despite the scent, the oil is very moisturizing and I continue to use this on a daily basis. Results were almost immediate and the good news is the scent does seem to disappear after a little while\n",
            "Whether or not you get stretch marks is entirely genetic. I knew I would get stretch marks with pregnancy since I already had them on my legs. I’ve been using bio oil about every other day and a bump cream the other days. I still got stretch marks but I will say that the bio oil definitely helps with the itchiness compared to a cream or lotion. I gave it 5 stars because I believe it works as it should even though it didn’t prevent my stretch marks (impossible). It moisturizes well. I plan on using it postpartum too.\n"

I also occasionally use it on dry spots on my face and it does amazing things! It moisturizes quickly and absorbs into the skin well so it doesn’t leave a really oily feeling, for me at least. I highly suggest this oil to everyone💖\n",
            "Like other reviewers mentioned, not sure if this is a fake or not. I've used it continuously every day for three months on two small scars. The scars are about six months old. I used generous amounts on each scar, let it dry before putting on clothes. There has been no improvement, no lightening, nothing. The smell is nice, but honestly this was a waste of money as there's no changes. Congrats to everyone that did see improvement, but this was useless for me.\n",
            "Bought this for my TT surgery and works great on scars. I also found out that it works to heal burns very quickly as well. Had grease splatter on my face and had some small 2nd degree burns. This stuff cut the healing time in half for me and the burns went away within days. Now I use it on every skin ailment that comes by me lol\n",
            "Bought my first bottle years and years ago for a friend with a surgery scar *wanna say 2008?). Had seen an ad in a magazine for it and thought he might like it. Started using it on my face ever since - thinking if it was good for scars I would try it on wrinkles ahaha - who knows if it's really good for that). I remember writing to the company about it but hearing no reply. I honestly do get so many compliments that people are surprised by how old I am - they all say I look ten years younger. I exercise, drink a ton of water, don't drink or smoke, and use BioOil as my moisturizer - no joke. I recommend and hope it is helpful.\n",
            "I do not have sensitive skin so I’m not sure if this would react with those who have sensitive skin however, I found it heavily perfumed. I try to avoid heavy fragranced skin care products especially since I ordered this to dermaroll/micro needling. It felt pleasant on the skin and seemed to absorb quickly. If this oil had a more faint/natural scent I would be happier. Apart from that I think it’s fine.\n",
            "Smells great. Got rid of my stretch marks so quickly and cellulite. Was super insecure about them and now I feel much better. Also helped decrease the look of harsh scars. I think it helps my acne too maybe? I did break out in an irritated red reaction on my chest tho. This isn’t my first bottle. So it’s overall great\n",
            "This stuff works like no other product out there. However, this is not real bio oil. Next time I won't be so lazy and I'll just go to cvs! The box was open and the botle wasn't sealed. I have been using this for years, the real one. This one I bought on amazon is thin has a different scent and doesnt look anything like my other bottle.The plastic bottle is even thinner. Buy elsewhere.\n",

Aside from my breasts, I'll be using this Bio-Oil on my belly and thighs to help prevent other stretch marks from appearing.I plan on updating this review throughout my pregnancy. Really have high hopes for this product going by the reviews!03/05: Sadly, I'm going to have to stop using this product. Rashes have formed in the areas where I've applied this oil. The worst ones were on my breasts where I've applied the most oil. Maybe I used too much product? Either way, I'm going to use coconut oil in place of the Bio Oil. At least until my rashes go away and I'll try again at a later date.\n",
            "I’ve been using this product everyday for a little under 2 months. At first, I was afraid I wasn’t going to like putting oil on my face, but it’s not so bad. It gives your skin a dewy look, which is nice. Although I haven’t seen any significant changes in my skin tone and stretch marks, it’s a REALLY good moisturizer. It didn’t make me break out, and doesn’t sting when I apply it, which usually happens with other moisturizers. My skin is very oily, and this product hasn’t really changed my skin’s oil production.\n",
            "I don’t have an authentic bottle to compare this to so I won’t know if it’s real or not and also have never used it, but this thing made me very itchy and got hives on my new incision scar. It turned so red it’s almost purple. Horrible!!!\n",

            "This paired with dermarolling is the only reason my deep thick stretch marks are improving. They were a dark dark purple and now are a purple red. Massive improvement. I literally cried when someone commented on noticing the difference because I was so happy!\n",
            "Bio oil has helped me immensely. I’ve purchased the big bottle 3 times. I first began using it for a surgery scar on my knee. It faded a lot, to the point that it’s not noticeable anymore. Then, for a medical condition I had to take steroids on and off for months which gave me purple stretch marks because I gained weight fast. They were all up and down my inner legs and now, most have faded or at the very least look lighter after about 2 months of use. I find that the best way to apply this stuff is twice a day and to leave it on for at least 20 minutes. Let it soak into your skin! Give it time. It works very well for me! Would recommend for scars and stretch marks\n",
            "I have horribly dry skin and then moved to the desert. Ugh. Regular water based moisturizers just don’t cut it. I started using this as an oil on my face. It absorbs well, improves my skin tone and helps to smooth on my foundation or tinted moisturizer/ sunblock. It hasn’t clogged my pores or given me any breakouts. I’ve used it for over a year now. If your skin is dry like an alligator and needs some soothing/healing, give this a try.\n",
            "I am so in love with this product. I mean within the 1st 2 weeks I noticed a difference. I have been using it a little over 3 months and now I'm addicted. I have to have it on fresh out the shower while still wet daily. It has definitely place an evenly beautiful skin tone for my entire body. When I read it was okay to put it on my face, which I have sensitive skin, omg it makes me look amazing. My daughter got me to use this product as she was only using it for her buttocks🤭. When I told her I use it on my entire body including my ears, she started doing the same thing. Then I started telling her how beautiful her face was forgetting she started using this on her face. The disadvantage of the product is that my skin is ashy by the end of the day but that's doesn't stop me from using it. Now I have it on auto-purchase. I am extremely happy as a Black Woman.\n",
            "Bought this product for my sister! I used it a couple years back for stretchMarks and it worked super well! I got a little rash at first but my skin is super sensitive! Would definitely recommend if you are trying to get rid of or lessen the appearance of stretchmarks! Works well and the scent is really good! It does not leave your skin dry!\n",
            "I use it for my belly to prevent stretch marks after I got pregnant. It's not the easiest oil to be used as it's really thick. I find it easier to apply if you don't dry your body completely. With a little water remind, it's the best time to apply it. So far I have not yet seen any stretch marks. Not sure it's bcoz of bio-oil or my body type. I would say it's not a bad product but it takes time for you to adjust the way it applies\n",
            "I have been a Bio Oil for many years so I am very familiar with this product.  What I received in no way is the real product.  The scent and texture were nothing like the real product.  Plus, the product did not have a anti-tampering seal on the bottle.  Clearly, the fake product I received had been used. Returned for a refund.\n",
            "I received this in my Amazon baby box, and I ended up switching from using Palmer's cocoa butter to this for stretch marks prevention. Now I know skin is different and this product may not be 'the miracle' but I do not have one single stretch marks at 36 weeks pregnant. I slathered this stuff on my belly, hips and breasts every single night minus maybe 5 nights because I fell asleep early. It smells wonderful and doesn't leave an overly oily residue. It soaks in just right. I also used it on some solar dermatitis that I got on my hands and it cleared it right up.\n",
            "Ok, I have only had this product for a couple of days so I cant speak for its efficacy over the long term, but I can say that this oil is deep penetrating, and relieves itchiness associated with pregnancy belly growth.  That being said, holy cow, that scent.  It's quite strong, and I can only describe it as that old perfume smell that circulates around a group of grandmas when they are in a group.  I dont mean to be rude or belittle any grandma, but there is a distinct too much and to many smells that is kind of the grandma essence.  This company has somehow bottled that and jacked it up to an 11.  Personally, I prefer earthy scents so this one is a bit difficult to use especially first thing in the morning, so take that for what it's worth I guess.\n",
            "I’m a nurse and my hands are destroyed from washing them, thanks to our friend COVID. I have been slathering them in anything I can find to help... nothing makes any difference UNTIL I received this in the mail last night. Two applications later my hands are at least 50% better. It smells nice too.\n"

            "This stuff is AMAZING! A little bit goes a looooong way, and the moisturizing factor is off the charts! It doesn’t say to use it on lips, but my chronically chapped and peeling lips... after just ONE use... are now soft and beautiful. I’m just stunned. I’ve put it on my beginning forehead wrinkles and it softened them immediately.I. ADORE.  THIS.  MIRACLE.  OIL.\n",
            "I USED THIS THE ENTIRE TIME I WAS PREGNAT AND IM SO GLAD I DID. I WENT BACK AND FORTH WITH THIS AND COCO BUTTER. IT REALLY HELPED AND WETHER IT WAS THIS PRODUCT OR JUST GOOD GENES, I DIDNT GET ANY STRETCH MARKS. SO THANK FUL. I ALSO USE THIS TO MOISTURIZE  MY FACE AT NIGHT ( KEEP AWAY FROM EYES) WHICH I FEEL HELPS WITH DELAYING THOSE WRINKLES. I ALWAYS GET COMPLMENTS ON MY SKIN. I ALSO USE IT FOR MY NECK AND HANDS. IT DID CLEAR UP SOME UN EVEN TONES ON MY FACE. IM PRETTY HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT AND ITS NOT EXPENISVE TO KEEP USING.\n",
            "I bought this oil to apply on my stomach during my pregnancy. It helps to keep my skin hydrated and the smell is not bad. I generously apply it twice a day to help reduce the dark coloring of my stretch marks (seems to be working... somewhat). I do plan to purchase another bottle as I like how it makes my skin feel. I’ve also began applying it to my face and love how it makes my face glow! It’s not too oily when applied sparingly and keeps my skin from flaking which it’s been doing since being pregnant.\n",
            "Bio-Oil is a must for me. I’ve used this product for 13 years. It helped my scar after neck surgery, my face after some pre-cancer treatments that desperately needed tender care.This oil is smooth and soaks into your skin, it has a light pleasant fragrance.You’ll want to keep this on hand. I’ve even had men  in my family use it after stitches to eliminate scarring.( Amazon has the best price for the most ounces)\n",
            "I bought this because I thought for a second that my stretch marks needed to be removed. I learned that 1. stretch marks are normal and a part of life. 2. there isn't a way to remove them especially with an oil like this. 3. This product is a waste of money. I am better off using lotion or a better body oil. I didn't like the smell of this and it left a weird residue on my skin. Not worth the money and I will not be repurchasing this or recommending this to anyone I know.\n",
            "This item has changed my skin. I’ve been utilizing it for a year and a half and my skin is way better than ever. I blend mine with tea tree oil to treat my skin break out. It’s light, it smells awesome, and it treats existing skin harm. In case you've got sun harm, little wrinkles, discoloration, or skin break out scars you ought to deliver this six months and see in case it works for you.\n",
            "I bought this to use to try to lessen the appearance of stretch marks. I know I’m going to get them and there’s no actual product to prevent them. This is promoted as a product to use during pregnancy for stretch marks but upon further investigation I discovered it contains a form of retinol that my obgyn told me to avoid during pregnancy. So it’s a good product that I haven’t been able to utilize to the fullest yet. Post baby I’m spattering this on. I was also using on scars and scabs and it did help them heal faster.\n",
            "I have dry, sensitive skin, which makes it a vigorous process of elimination for the skincare products just to help me find the right product. I pay close attention to skincare routine suggestions and there was one that stood out:After you take a warm shower, you look into the mirror and your skin looks at its best... but not for long. This is because your skin is highly moisturized from the shower and the humid environment of your bathroom, but this moisture evaporates approximately after 15 seconds of stepping out of the shower. It significantly helps to apply facial oil within this 15 second-time-limit, and this oil helps create a barrier to trap in the moisture. Afterwards, you can relax and take your time to complete the rest of your skincare routine like you usually do.Because I still have some scars on my face, I bought this oil as an addition to my routine. My skin does feel a lot smoother and I have not struggled with dry patches or irritations ever since.\n",

            "I planned to use to help with some old scars.  With my first use, I poured too much oil out (I don’t like the way it dispenses) so decided to just keep massaging in until it was absorbed.  Mulch to my surprise, it extracted a number of large blackheads and dead skin plugs!  I was very surprised because I use an oil cleanser nightly and didn’t expect this but was very happy with the result!  Now I plan to use as a double cleanse option and, over time, maybe it will also help my old scars.\n",
            "Initially excited and appeared good, but sadly disappointed. I thought this would be great to use to moisturize my belly during my first pregnancy. I ordered during the first trimester and waited to use it until the second trimester as it says on the bottle. I enjoyed the smell, textured seemed good for moisturizing but after a couple of uses I noticed my belly getting REALLY itchy every time I used it. At first I thought it was just dry skin but it was only on my belly. Unfortunately the return window has already closed because I followed the directions and didn’t start using until the second trimester. Very disappointed.\n",
            "I was ready to write a really good review about this stuff, I started using it for stretch marks and scars on my arms and legs. I liked the way it smelled it kept my skin moisturized and it seemed to be working. I felt like my stretch marks and scars were starting to fade. But then I started breaking out on my arms and a few spots on my legs, my skin felt irritated and I had to stop using it. I got through about half the bottle then I started breaking out. I have really sensitive skin so I would not recommend this to anyone who has sensitive skin.\n",
            "Used this product from week 16 through week 34 of my pregnancy. Received a sample in my amazon registry box and thought it was actually working so I bought a second bottle during my third trimester. This is my first pregnancy so I didn’t know what to expect, but my belly grew quicker after 30 weeks and I started to see stretch marks. Used more of the product and it was not improving anything and I was still pretty itchy due to the stretching. Switched to Palmers stretch mark relief and within a couple days it began to fade the marks and stopped the itching. This product did not work for me and it smells like a stale tanning salon.\n",
            "I’ve been using this since I became pregnant. It’s really helped during the dry winter weather to help lock in moisture and with the changing body.\n",
            "I got this and had a similar experience as others, I received this oil and it smells strongly like cinnamon. Then my body started breaking out with red dots.....buy it from a store directly!\n",
            "I’ve seen this stuff at Walmart but I’ve never picked up a bottle because it’s so expansive for such a a tiny bottle and I wasn’t sure if it would even work.I’ve been using this stuff for a week and while I don’t have stretch marks from my baby yet!! I do have some old acne scars from high school, along with red, uneven skin, and it seems to help with the appearance of the redness at least. I actually can’t tell if it’s working on the scars yet. Will update if possible!\n",
            "Pros: It’s a great size- a little goes a long way and should last the entire pregnancy.Cons: the smell is kind of funky and it does not help with itching. I put it on when I’m itchy, after showers and before bed.I’m 25 weeks and counting, so I can’t speak to stretch mark prevention.. but I haven’t seen any yet! Overall it’s not my favorite product or first choice. I feel like I need to add an anti-itch moisturizer to my routine.\n",
            "I had some I ordered for some scars.  I decided to use it on my face after hearing people talk about using it on their face with positive results.  I am surprised at how well it worked on my face.  Even wrinkles are starting to slowly disappear.  I use it once or twice a day and it absorbs quickly leaving my skin very very soft.  The scars I had on my nose have started to disappear.  It's amazing stuff.  Much like high end serums that charge $100 and more.  It's amazing stuff.  I started using it on my hands recently and my hands are so soft.  The possibilities are endless with this amazing stuff.\n"

I find not only does this help my dry skin but also with my acne breakouts.  I know!  Putting oil on acne, get out!  But it really works to help moisturize my skin so my body stops trying to self moisturize and clogging up my pores.  Try it, you might love it as much as I do!\n",

It's not a miracle worker. I noticed improvement (fading) in 3-5 days, but it's an ongoing process of continuing to use the product to fade the blemishes. It also has improved the health of my facial skin overall.\n",
            "My doctor kept telling me to just use vitamin E for my surgical scar but I was convinced there must be something better. This really is the only product that has consistently soothed the ache of the scar. You can still see the scar but it just happened in August. Still I have tried many other products over the weeks and keep coming back to this for soothing the ache of the pinched stretched skin\n",
            "The oil is really nice. The smell isn’t too strong, too. It has helped my skin stay hydrated, but I haven’t seen a huge difference with the pregnancy stretch marks. I had in my head that the oil would lighten the marks in about 2 weeks, but I’ve been using it for almost two months every single day, and the marks are still very visible in some sections of my body. I do love using the oil and enjoy the consistency after using it. My body doesn’t feel oily, my skin soaks it in. Overall nice product.\n",
            "I seriously have seen such a difference on my belly! The stretch marks on my belly have lightened so much it’s seriously shocking. All my stretch marks are from pregnancies 7 years ago and then 3 years ago not new ones. Hope this helps!\n",
            "Um, wow. I don’t even know where to begin. I originally got this as part of my skincare routine for my face, but then saw that it could be used on scars as well, so I figured I’d give it a try - couldn’t make things worse, right? I’ve been using this twice a day on the scar on my wrist for 3 weeks, and it has made a HUGE difference. The color is lighter, it’s less raised overall, and it seems to have actually gotten smaller. As a disclaimer, the “before” picture was more than 3 weeks before the “after” picture because I didn’t have a more recent one, but it’s an accurate representation of how my scar looked before starting in with the Bio-Oil. I’m excited to continue using it to see if it helps even more, but if it doesn’t, this is a huge improvement, and I’m so happy with how it’s performed!\n",
            "I absolutely love bio oil...BUT it has Vitamin A in it. I am a little disappointed that it is advertised as safe to use while pregnant. I was lathering this on my belly until my doctor told me to stay away from it. Vitamin A is a retinol and research suggests that all retinoids should be discontinued during pregnancy. Just a heads up for those who did not know this!\n",

I am currently 8 months pregnant so I am also using it in my belly hoping it will prevent stretch marks there. Here crossing fingers that it does. So far no stretch marks in my belly.\n",
            "Advertised as \"non greasy\" which doesn't make sense this is literally an oil that sits right on top of the skin and take forever to absorb. The smell is off putting to me. It has a cheap fragrance smell to it the reminds me of what my grandmother used to use all the time. It smells exactly like \"skin so soft\"  oil from the 90s. Why is this fragrance necessary? I could see it triggering a migraine if you are sensitive.\n",
            "When I got pregnant I had two friends insist that I needed to buy this since they both used it and never got any stretch marks. I've been using it now since the beginning of the second trimester and I'm 33 weeks and don't see a single stretch mark. I use it every morning and evening, and it makes my belly feel really soft and moisturized. It's a bit pricey, but I think it's worth it!\n",
            "I have heard so much about bio oil, and decided to buy this product. I ignored the reviews that said it was counterfeit. I wish I wouldn’t have. This oil burnt my face. It was so red and hurt really bad, I would try and put lotion on it to soothe it and it would make it burn even more so very uncomfortable!Do not use if you have sensitive skin!!!!!\n",
            "Pic is top-feb 19th bottom is May 19th. I’ve used this now for 3 months, everyday after shower or every other day. It’s a little greasy after use so I wash my hands. I started using on my fresh 6 month belly stretch marks after twin pregnancy. I don’t know if I can really tell a huge difference so I will keep using. Always worth a try. Get small bottle it goes a long way, or maybe I’m not using enough. Lol.  UPDATE!! 4 months of use after every shower.\n",
            "Has a nice scent and absorbs rather quickly. It’s great for sensitive skin. Very moisturizing. I’m currently using it for baby belly stretch marks. I’m using it daily. I don’t feel greasy or icky after I put it on. Overall great product.\n",
            "This product is magic! I originally purchased it in 2018 with my first pregnancy to help prevent stretch marks. I didn't think I could say enough good things about it then, as I didn't get a single stretch mark! I purchased it again for pregnancy #2 ,and not only do I use it on my belly but recently have been using it on my face. It may sound crazy, but my typically oily skin is much smoother and even. It even seems to help keep my acne at bay! Truly amazing!\n",
            "Composed of mostly meneral oil, this product does hydrate.I have been using it dor about 2 weeks.I was in a car wreck that caused sever abdominal scaring. I see no change in appearance as they advertise.\n",
            "I absolutely love this! I'm 8 months pregnant with twins so I'm huuuuge. I think stretch marks mostly happen based on genetics and thats probably why I don't have any (yet). HOWEVER, I put this stuff on at night and my skin is so so so soft. I can tell its really absorbing it. My legs also get really bad razer burn after shaving(I'm cursed). Usually the only thing I can put on is coconut oil, but now I can use bio oil and it doesn't sting at all!\n",
            "This has really helped me with some old scars.  I use it once a day before I go to bed.  A little goes a long way!  Within a month or so I was seeing a difference in my scars.  Would definitely recommend!\n"

Of course that could be from a few of the oils found in bio-oil that are very beneficial to us for many reasons, Lavender, Rosemary and Chamomile Oil. I talked my fiancé into trying it and was surprised that he liked the smell and all around results when using bio-oil 1-2 times daily. Will recommend and will buy again !\n",
            "After having my first baby, I noticed my skin became sensitive and very dry. The normal lotion didn't fit my need, so I added 2 drops into the lotion to moisture my whole body skin every day. After using it for 3 days, my skin became better! That's impressive. I'd highly recommend not to use too many drops once, or it would cause acne. However, I didn't like the design of the bottle itself. Why not design it as a push-on bottle? It's very inconvenient. I waste a lot of the oil just because it slips from my oily hand... That's super annoying.\n",
            "This oil was recommended by my doctor after a procedure on my legs caused hyperpigmentation. I used it every day but the dark patches never faded away so I stopped using it after 3 months.\n",
            "This is like my 10,000ty bottle of bio oil. I swear, I used this my entire pregnancy and I didn’t get one stretch mark. I also used it on my face for a while and notice some old acne scars started to fade. It’s a little thick to use on your face all the time though. The formula is long lasting because of how thick the oil feels.\n",
            "Quick turnaround time from order to delivery but when I opened the package the box was damaged. Luckily, the actual product wasn’t leaking or it was definitely getting returned. I love this stuff and definitely in need since I’m further in my third trimester, I am not willing to go through the hassle of returning only to run into the same issue again. Figured might as well keep it. Please do better with the packaging though. Highly disappointing.\n",
            "While it's a healing oil and it moisturizes well, it leaves a tacky feeling after applying. However, works well for its intent if you can get over that feeling.Unfortunately it arrived in an open box, so that made me nervous but I still used it and its a fine product, nothing amazing for me personally.\n",
            "I really enjoyed this product. The scent isn’t awful but it definitely isn’t pleasant. I have very sensitive skin and I’ve had no issues at all. I use this oil after my shower nightly, and wash off what ever is left over the next morning. It is an oil so I do not use it durning the day for the sole purpose that it makes my face super shiny. I can’t say if the product lives up to its intended use, but regardless I love this stuff. I also have only used it on my face so I can’t comment for use in other areas. I wouldn’t say it’s moisturizing but it’s for sure hydrating. I can’t wait to see what it does for my skin in the winter. And I will say my natural skin seems to be so radiant and glowing after using this consistently.\n",
            "Fake product mostly just water or extremely diluted, no oily feeling as compared to the same product I purchased from store. Shame on the seller and manufacturer\n",
            "Currently 6 weeks postpartum. I enjoyed the scent, my husband hated the smell. Used it on off throughout my first (only) pregnancy, delivered my baby, never had any stretch marks. Pretty sure it’s not because of this since I didn’t use it consistently but who knows. As for stretch marks I had on my inner thighs, I was also applying... they didn’t disappear but are very unnoticeable to others.\n",
            "This is my first time ever using this product. I thought it was just for pregnant women but when I got my scars from a gallbladder removal and a blood drain tube I was recommended this product by a coworker. First; the presentation of this product is beautiful, secondly; the smell is so light and soothing, and third and most importantly; this actually works. It's not a miracle overnight remedy but by using it for only a month I can already see a change in my scars and the quality of my skin around the area. I now use this for my hands too, especially as the colder weather is starting to set in, as well as scaring from mosquito bites this summer. I love this product and will be ordering again!\n",

She said I need to buy “him his own bottle!” Her arms should be in a commercial for Biooil. If I took a before/after pic no one would believe it. After just 3 days. This stuff is beyond my expectations. It is something so odd how it’s oil but not oily. It actually does go in your skin and you can actually unscrew a cap with it on your hands because it’s NOT OILY. Crazy but true. It works wonders on dry skin. And I’ve never even tried it on scars. Just the elderly because I’m a nurse.\n",

I saw the bottle was different but mines actually came in like the original one! Packaging & everything was exactly how it was suppose to be! And the smell?? It smelled like the actual one & even had that consistency! I definitely recommend getting it, I’ll let y’all know if it actually works! :)\n",

I have hope that this will perform like they claim!  I am very happy so far!\n",
            "I had used this previously for stretch marks and i worked well.  Someone told me it works well as a facial moisturizer and wont clog pores.  I was hesistant because pretty much all facial products make me break out and sure enough I did get not one single blemish when I started using this.\n",
            "I have a surgery scar on the inside of my wrist/forearm and it was recommended that I try this to help moisturize and decrease the scar. Unfortunately, I have sensitive skin and after putting this on, I got immediate hives, redness and terrible itching. I couldn't power through the insensitivity and ended up having to wash my arm several times to get it off. If you have sensitive skin, try in a VERY small area first.\n",

It hydrates my skin and leaves a smooth finish, but dark spots and stretch marks have rarely faded because of this product. It doesn't matter how much or how less you use, this results are pretty simple. If it was slightly better I'd buy again.\n"

Make sure you buy the right bottle, not the copy cat that's why there is a mix of reviews. This does not smell much and she feels it helping. It is oil so let it absorbed before putting clothes over. Try doing this after a bath and towel dry. Even the bumps are diminishing. Just keep being persistent. It's been a couple of months and they are looking lighter and smoother! I would recommend!\n",

I’m currently 26 weeks pregnant and have no stretch marks (not sure when they start appearing) I started off using the bio oil gel with belli oil. but as soon as I started using the bio oil oil my sides broke out. I have tiny pimple like bumps. They’re not itchy nor they hurt but they look so ugly and it’s been about three weeks and I still have them\n",

            "on performance i'd rate bio-oil a five. unfortunately, to me, the fragrance of the product was so sicking sweet i discontinued use after four applications. the aroma lingers, it doesn't wear down. in the morning it will smell as it did at night. the smell isn't strong like bad perfume or over powering like cigar smoke it's just sickeningly sweet. it's an unidentifiable aroma.however, we experience smell differently so it may not bother you. others have posted they liked the fragrance.i bought bio-oil for moisture and on that count it worked very well. my skin is highly sensitive and i had no problems.\n",
            "My husband’s friend recommended this product to prevent stretch marks. I didn’t have stretchmarks but my pregnant tummy was getting bigger so I purchased this. After one application, my stomach broke out in hives and became unbearably itchy so I started scratching so I ended up with stretch marks which beats the purpose of buying and using this. I threw it away. It was a waste of money for me since it’s so expensive :(.\n",
            "I been using it for a month and it has actually made some results. My skin is softer to the touch, skin tone seems like it equalized overall so i got a better skin color or maybe less marks. My nose used to dry and have dead skin over it and hasnt happen lately. So far so good. Might keep buying. I noticed some decreased scar visibility, gonna take time for sure but its showing some result\n",
            "I started using Bio Oil during the first trimester with my first child. A veteran you tube momma recommended it in one of her videos to prevent and minimize stretch marks. I was terrified of getting that squiggly lined loose skin appearance on my stomach/breasts. The directions say to start two a day applications during second trimester. I started during my first. I'm using Bio Oil again now for my second pregnancy and I'm seven months along with ZERO stretch marks, scars or loose skin ANYWHERE on my body. Yes, I know, this is much attributed to genetics and body type but I am a firm believer that the BIO OIL is the overall culprit for my skins success throughout my two pregnancies. I always recommend this to any newly pregnant mom and if I the Lord blesses me with anymore babies in the future, I will 100% be using my beloved BIO OIL. A must have during AND after pregnancy!\n",
            "After about 2 months and 2 bottles  of consistent use I have seen a noticeable difference I wish I had more before pictures but my stretch marks were always embarrassing and very thick and deep after weight loss . this product definitely lightened them and made the appearance less pronounced. I could imagine if your stretch marks aren’t as deep as mine we’re this could remove them completely.\n",
            "I am using this for EVERYTHING!  I have only used it a few days and already see a dramatic difference in my skin.  i bought this because I just had a mole removed and my daughter has a scar on her face.  We are applying to these areas, but I have used as a moisturizer on my skin (dry), my daughter's skin (combination), both of my sons (both dry, one acne prone) and my husband's skin (oily).  We are all glowing!  and the fine lines in my forehead are noticeably less!!\n",
            "The scent is a light rose. Directions say to apply twice a day, so I apply when I wake up and when I go to sleep. I am using this while pregnant to prevent stretch marks. It says to start in the second trimester, which I have. It is definitely keeping my stomach skin soft. Prior to use, my stomach skin was itchy. I did have one small stretch mark from a previous pregnancy and it is helping that mark be less noticeable.\n",
            "I bought it for lightening my scars, I put it on once a day throughout the whole healing process, but it doesn’t seems to work. As for moisturizing, it’s more like putting oil to cover your pores instead of moisturizing. My skin doesn’t seems to absorb the product as it’s too oily. It didn’t give me any allergic reaction, which is good, but it didn’t get me the result I want either.\n",
            "Nothing but low quality products that sit on top of your skin to trick you into thinking its making your skin softer when It isn’t. The Purcellin oil is trademarked by the company which should be a red flag... the ingredients are mostly chemicals that change the texture and “oiliness” of the product but are not chemicals that benefit the skin in any way. I’ve used It for months and saw zero results... if anything it just clogged my pores because the main ingredient (mineral oil) is paraffin!! My skin is softer after using my usual moisturizer and throwing this product away. Always do your research!\n",
            "This stuff is gold. I think it’s a little pricey for an oil but I’m glad I bought it. It is really great. Even on the face. It eventually dries all the way and really leaves a nice moisturized skin. I love it and will use this for a long long time.\n"

It has really evened out my skin tone and my face is so soft. It has helped with wrinkles a little, but now I use it to dilute stronger creams so I don't burn my skin. I use it on my cuticles as well and my nails look great. It is pricey, but  a little goes a long way.\n",
            "I used this product my entire pregnancy once or twice a day (especially after the shower) and I didn’t get any stretch marks on my belly! (I used the oil then put raw Shea butter on top to be safe) I already had stretch marks on my butt so I put a lot of trust in this product and I was not disappointed. I HATED the smell (smells like a guy fragrance or grandpa) it was strong too. I’m also sad that people said this is a fake because that’s bogus.\n",
            "Made me break out. Not sure about other benefits but after I looked up the ingredients. There are ingredients makes you break out easy. After I stop using it for just a week lot of the acne I got from using this product went away. You can look this up your self. But if you are using it for scars or stretch marks, I don’t know about it.\n",
            "I have been using this for months now, and it helps with the scars. I started using this to help with my acne scars. It does help, but it also takes time. I still have scars but now they are not as noticeable. Seeing as I have dry skin it is a bit moisturizing but not a lot. Thankfully it doesn't stink. The only thing I would change about it would be the applicator. I like to transfer it to a bottle that has dropper as the lid. I would put 2 drops on each cheek and 1 on my forehead.\n",
            "I love this oil, it wipes out any dry patches on my face. I live in Chicago and change my skincare seasonally because my summer moisturizer isn’t heavy enough for the dry winter, I get dry patches on my cheekbones, around my eyes and on my chin. This oil is what will get me through the cold temps and high winds, ya know the kind of weather that makes your face hurt.\n",
            "I am currently 9 months pregnant and have been using this since the first trimester. I wear it only at night because right do t want to be oily during the day. During the day I wear cocoa butter and then I literally bathe in this thunk before bed time. I haven’t gotten a single stretch mark due to the pregnancy. I want to add that I do have stretch marks before I got pregnant so my skin is prone to have stretch marks in the base case which made me extremely worried when I got pregnant. But a friend recommended this and it really made a difference. The smells isn’t great, but who cares!!! No stretch marks is worth it!\n",
            "I used this with my first pregnancy and I’m now using it for my second! It help moisten and I didn’t have any stretch marks. I know most people say that’s up to genetics but both my sisters got stretch marks with their pregnancies so 🤷‍♀️ I also have super sensitive skin, I get a rash from everything and this was amazing for me!\n",
            "I have been using Bio-Oil for over 3 years now, since it was recommended to me by my doctor post-surgery to speed healing and reduce scarring. I absolutely love it! I use it just about every day. I have incredibly sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts, and I can even use it on my face without a problem. I use it every single time I get out of the shower on my face, decolletage, hands and any breakouts I have that are healing. It absorbs quickly and leaves no greasy residue.\n",
            "I found this recommended for treating scars by people who had a breast augmentation. I have been applying this on my neck and face. I have no issues and it is very smooth and non greasy. I cannot tell if the scars are better due to this or the Silagen that was given to me by the plastic surgeon, either way, I am using it and feels like my fine lines are diminishing\n",
            "I've been using Bio-Oil twice a day for about 3 weeks, and it is amazing. I am noticing that a deep scar that I've had on my face since I was 9 (I'm 37 now), from a dog attack is starting to look better already! Also, my forehead lines are looking less prominent. I am AMAZED by this product and will continue using it for years to come.\n",

I also got a smaller sized one just in case it didn’t work out, I’m glad I took the chance on this!\n",

            "As someone who has skin that scars super easily, bio oil is really helpful and there’s a noticeable difference in my scars. HOWEVER, I also have acne prone skin, so when I apply it to my oily T-zone I break out more. Thus I now only use it on my body and cheek areas and I have no complaints :)\n",

The indicator cannot be duplicated!!! This product also came on time and in good condition. If you want bio-oil this vendor is safe to purchase from. Hope this help those of you who are concerned based off the comments, like myself.\n",

I wanted to give it a fair trial time to see if it worked, and unfortunately I missed the return window otherwise would have returned. Very Disappointed, it was not cheap.\n",

            "very moisturizing! i love putting bio oil on after the shower and it has made my stretch marks less red (over the last 6 months) in conjunction weight. i notice that when i don't use bio oil the stretch marks on my hips are puffed up more. oldest scars have started to become less visible. i use this on my face because i have dry skin on my cheeks and it makes my face feel like butter. i can also wait for it to absorb and put lotion on top of it and be fine and not break out. i just wish it would work better on some of my face scars because i will have 3-4 pimples at a given time but they scar bad and most of the blemishes i have are just dark spots.\n",
            "I had a new inscion on my thigh from a hip surgery. I rubbed the Bio-Oil in two to four times a day without noticing any improvement with the appearance of the scar. The Bio-Oil smells good and works as a moisturizer but I purchased it for the scar appearance to be improved. It did not work for me.\n",
            "I do not like the fact that the #1 ingredient is mineral oil. Everyone has always said this is the best product for stretch marks and to moisturize the skin. I use it on my face after I use a scrub to help bring the moisture back into my skin. This is a double edged sword as it does not dry and clogs my pores. The bottle states it is for face and body, so I'm not using it wrong.\n",
            "I don’t have the most sensitive skin at all! But I am having really bad rashes (I thought because of my stretch lines). I figured I needed more moisture.  I use Palmers Whicht calms my skiing irritation but the stretch lines are not going away. So when I read the reviews I figured it will go away without 3 weeks. Every time I apply it, although the scent is good, it causes a bad irritation on my skin so I have to start all over. Did not work on my skin.\n",
            "I originally gave this a low rating and decided to come back and change it after giving this a second chance. I have horribly dry, acne prone skin, and didn't really see any benefit this product could offer when I was first recommended to try it. Now, after giving it a second chance, I can see why people love this stuff. Not only has it moisturized my skin, but it's helping with the appearance of my old acne marks and just makes my skin look healthier in general. There's also the added bonus that it hasn't seemed to cause any additional breakouts for me, which many products do. I will definitely buy this again.\n",
            "Love this so much! I tell all my friend/family to get it!i had a noticeable improvement in stretch marks within the first couple of weeks. I have reordered it once already and will continue to do so. It isn’t greasy. Smells very lightly scented and just makes my skin soft. Highly recommend trying it!\n",
            "I was a huge skeptic... How can an oil reduce thick, dark, and unsightly scars? Well, I'm no longer questioning it because this stuff WORKS! I'm so impressed with it and its only been 3 months of daily use. It's significantly improved my scar, just look at my pic! I'm going to continue using it everyday as I'm sure it'll only keep reducing the redness around my scar. So happy!\n",

            "Ive used this with both of my pregnancies it it worked wonders for my skin. I like to mix mine with my moisturizer and body lotion. I also used this for my scars from having my gallbladder out and they have faded drastically. I know a lot of these reviews said fake but mine was true to color and smell and same consistency so no issue there. If you’re scared to buy off here at least try it from the store, you won’t be disappointed!\n",
            "I love this stuff. A dermatologist recommended it to me years ago to help fade scars, and I just recently started using it again for stretch marks during pregnancy. I use it everyday, twice a day. It’s very moisturizing and lasts a pretty long time. The scent is nice too. I was hesitant to buy it at first because of the reviews that say it’s fake, but I didn’t notice any difference in color, consistency, or scent between this one and the one I bought at the store. It takes a little bit of time to soak in, but after it does my skin feels really soft.\n",
            "Very good for healing scars when used with a fresh wounded area. Also used starting around week 35 to prevent tearing during childbirth and it worked great! The scent is the only thing I would change about it, not a great smell.\n",
            "I was skeptical about this product at first, but I’m so glad I tried it!! I use at night (it has replaced my Clinique products) and noticeable pimples disappear overnight with this product! It’s quite amazing. It’s very oily so I only use it at night (I use a light moisturizer during the day), but my skin absorbs the oil pretty readily. I’ve noticed improvement in blemishes as well as a brighter complexion in general. It’s amazing how well this product works, especially since it is so inexpensive.\n",
            "I look forward to bath time because it means I get to apply this right after. The scent is really divine. It isn’t overwhelming for me.I bought this because I’m pregnant (plus mommies-to-be community recommends this) and—although genetics plays a big role—I wanted to take certain steps to at least minimize stretch marks.  No stretch marks yet but it’s because I’m only 14 weeks, so I cannot vouch for the effectiveness yet.This does feel moisturizing and doesn’t feel greasy.Will recommend and repurchase. 👍🏽\n",
            "First time purchasing this so I can’t comment as to whether this is authentic or a knock-off of Bio oil. However, this oil is wonderful. It smells amazing, have a perfect consistency and makes my skin smooth and not greasy just as advertised. Will absolutely purchase again.\n",
            "I have not just super dry and super sensitive skin but also have Rosacia . My doctor recommended bio oil as I mentioned that my prescription Cremes make my skin feel even more dry and so I was given samples of bio oil to try . So far so good my skin appears to handle this product very well\n",
            "So far so good! I'll be 7 months next week and have been using it for almost two months now and I'm all out. No stretch marks yet (hopefully never) but I'm going to repurchase again!UPDATE: 4months post partumAs soon as I turned 9 month pregnant stretch marks came out of the no where! They were itchy and red and covered my whole entire belly! I was disappointed because I used this product religiously every single day 3 times a day! I’m not 4 months post partum and the stretch marks are still there. I’m still using this product with hopes they go away. But not expecting anything anymore.\n",
            "I was a tad skeptic as I read reviews that said the product was a scam and not the real thing. This is the same bio oil at the drugstores/target..etc It smells really good and feels good on my skin. I've been using it for almost 2 weeks and 2 tiny scars on my forearm have already faded dramatically. I bought it initially for a much larger scar and have been alternating between the bio oil and silicone scar tape. So far so good! Don't hesitate to purchase!\n",
            "So I bought this product to use for my stretch marks and I have been using it for almost 2 months and at first I really thought it was making a difference and I bought the bigger bottle, but i regretted it.  I looked at the before and after photos and saw no difference, I thought that at least I would avoid the appearance of new streaks, but even that didn't do it.  Disappointed\n"

However, the scent is so different from what I used in Ireland, that I could not use it, and  gave it away.This was always a good product, but the smell is too overpowering, something has changed. Dommage.\n",
            "I heard many good things about this product all overall social media about how well it heals scars. I personally have struggled with acne scars on my back and chest, so I thought I'd give this product a shot. It works awesome! I only put it on after I take showers and it has cleared my back and chest up so much! Highly recommend!\n",

I am a male who finally shaved his beard off and it hurt to even touch around my jawline due to build up of skin and undergrowth hair without shaving/exfoliating and now my skin has been rejuvenated, wrinkles decreasing to nearly gone on my forehead, skin color is back, the shape of my face is coming back and I just feel like I will use this product for the rest of my life\n",
            "I had to admit this but I’ve had a few stretch marks show up after a recent weight gain. After hearing about a pregnant friend use Bio oil on her bump, I thought I might as well give it a try! One week later and seriously my stretch marks are almost all the way gone. This stuff is a miracle worker!\n",
            "Had a cut and rash on my ankle and have been using this oil and Vaseline interchangeably so it doesn’t leave a scar. As you can tell by the before and after pictures it worked very well. Very oily though, unless you want stains all over your bed sheets you have to cover it or wrap it so it doesn’t get everywhere\n",
            "I looove this! My favorite moisturizing oil. Doesn’t feel heavy and the scent is very light. A little goes a long ways and is definitely worth it. I use it for my face (at night) and for my body, love that it’s multifunctional.\n",
            "I’ve been using this product to hopefully prevent stretch marks throughout my entire pregnancy pretty much, however I use it in conjunction with Burt’s Bees Belly Butter. After my showers, I apply the oil (let it soak in for a few minutes), then the belly butter and I still have 0 marks at 39 weeks pregnant.My mom and sister have stretch marks from their pregnancies so I expected to get them regardless, but I seem to still be in the clear. I don’t have much longer to be pregnant but I know if I end up having a c-section, I will definitely be applying this to that future scar too.I feel like this helps lighten some darker acne scars on my face too. I don’t use much, just moisturize those specific areas.\n",
            "The smell of this alone irritated my skin. None of what was promised happened, the fragrance made my skin itchy, it takes too long to sink in and never fully does and it didn’t fade my scars. I could only stand to use it a few times, I can’t believe something this strongly scented is marketed to people with sensitive skin.\n",
            "I have tried almost every product and home remedy to try to get rid of stretch marks or atleast fade them. I was successful with a it works cream but it only faded them. I have used for about a month and my dark purple stretch marks have turned white and my white ones seem to blend with my skin more. I am so happy with my results. I have refused to wear shorts/dresses for the ones on my legs and I'm getting excited for summer. I'm excited to continue using this products and see what further results it will bring. You do need to use this product EVERY morning and night. The price isn't bad for the size a small bottle lasted me about a month. I'll definitely be ordering a bigger bottle.\n",
            "This product is good.  It was recommended to me by my vascular doctor.  She said it was good.That was an understatement.  My skin on my leg is very dry and rough.  I have used prescription salves and non prescription products.  This beats them all.  Just takes a few drops to cover a good sized area twice a day.  If you have some really tough skin problems,, this product is certainly worth a try.\n",

I still have a ton left because a little goes a long way.It doesn't make you break out, and if anything it helps keep my skin clear.  It's difficult finding a moisturizer that ☑️ all the boxes but this is it!\n",

My skin was covered in a horrible rash and I have use the real bio oil before in my last pregnancy, so I know I’m not usually allergic. Do not buy this you will have scars all over your pregnant belly like me.\n",
            "Love this stuff. A friend recommended this product and she has amazing skin, so I tried it. I was a little nervous because I have oily skin, but I love it! I use it after washing my face in the evening. In the morning a just rinse my face with water and don’t need to re-moisturize. I have tried numerous facial lotions over the years and just hadn’t found anything I really liked. I also didn’t want to break the bank. This one works great and is super affordable.\n",
            "I bought this 3 weeks ago and I use it twice a day. I have already seen a big difference in the appearance of my skin. It really does work for even skin tone and scars. Will definitely buy again and recommend!\n",
            "I have sensitive skin and tried a cocoa butter oil on my pregnant belly and immediately broke out in a rash.. this Bio-Oil was a life saver and didn’t do that! I used it after every shower the last 3 months of pregnancy and only have 2 stretch marks! And my c-section scar is almost gone too now after only a few weeks of applying this to it! A must have for all mamas!\n",
            "I used this for the entire duration of my 2nd & 3rd Pregnancy, and I did not get the 1st stretch mark! It also reduces the appearance of old and new scars, with daily use! I use daily after I get out of the shower. I also use on my face as a massage oil for a rolling stone or facial massager. It has dramatically faded my old scars on my body, and acne scars on my face from when I was younger. I absolutley Bio oil. I recommend to everybody!\n",

            "I absolutely love this product. I’m currently 7 months pregnant and I apply this oil to my stomach. So far I have no stretch marks. This oil smells good as well. I definitely recommend and I will be repurchasing.\n",
            "I’ve been using this for a year now on my face and it feels great. It really has help even my skin tone on my face. It doesn’t clog my pores and I kind use it as a night time moisturizer.Update:I don’t use this anymore but not because it was bad but there are other natural oils that are better like rosehip, a than, or jojoba. This was a great starter, but there are better and cheaper alternatives.\n"

I have super sensitive skin and this didn't seem to irritate it for the two days I used it (once per day). But I honestly just couldn't stand the scent and decided to return it. It didn't give me a headache, I just found it unpleasant and pervasive.\n",
            "love this product. Used it from my 2nd trimester on, usually once in the morning and once in the evening. I didn't get a single stretch mark on my stomach or sides. I started using it because I had already started getting stretchmarks on my boobs ( booo ). my boob stretchmarks decreased in redness and i don't think i got many more (if any) since i started using it. Unfortunately I stopped using it once i gave birth. Well, when my milk came in i got more stretch marks on my boobs...In short, definitely decreased redness of my stretch marks. Probably stopped more from accumulating (but can't be 100% percent sure).\n",
            "I’ve only used 2 times and I hate the smell. So gross. Using it for pregnancy so can’t speak to how effective. It’s also a thicker sticky consistency. I wonder if this is actually the true bio oil people rave about. I recommend the Hatch oil 100x over this. More expensive but it has a pleasant smell and worked up through 8 mos\n",
            "Exactly what I needed! This helps with my scarring SO much.. I’ve been using it whenever I’ve needed to fade a new scar or old one, and now mine are almost not visible. I ordered this because no stores in my area stocked it, and to my surprise it was cheaper and arrived very quickly! Will definitely re-order when I’m out again.\n",
            "Box came damaged in the weirdest way, even thought the amazon envelope was undamaged which means it was likely shipped that way and not an issue with the carrier. The box had no safety seals, and the product itself did not have any either. I will still use it because it is for an old, healed scar on my leg but I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone with fresh scars or facial scarring. I recommend buying from a drugstore to make sure you’re getting the real thing\n",

            "So back in July I got breast augmentation surgery. Because of this I have dark purple and red scars under my breast and dark stretch marks forming on my breast. I’ve only been using this product for about 2 weeks. The first week I was only putting it on before bed but the second week I added it to my morning routine as well and WOW. This stuff works wonders! My stretch marks aren’t completely gone but the overall redness and purple ness is almost completely gone. As well as that silvery look you get from stretch marks as well! My scars are still very dark but not as raised as they were 2 weeks ago! Definitely recommend for smaller stretch marks! I’ll update my post with the results of my scarring as well.\n",
            "I heard very good things about this oil so I decided to give it a shot. I was sadly disappointed. I started using it when I was about 6 months pregnant. I am currently 5 months post partum. I didn't notice any real difference in my skin and it certainly hasn't help to prevent or lighten my stretch marks. The only good things I can say about it is that it obsorbs into the skin very well and isn't greasy.\n",

            "I really love this product. My self harm scars have started to fade and are less noticeable thanks to bio oil. I didn’t really think it’d work but it did. I know there’s someone out there struggling with the appearance of their scars and just know this works, you should try it out :) also apply once or twice a day. You’ll see results in a couple of months.\n",
            "My pregnant friend recommended this oil and I absolutely love it. I love the scent and how it feels on your skin. It doesn't stain my clothes. I don't really know if it's helping with stretch marks, but it does help with keeping my pregnant belly moisturized. I notice if I don't use it that my belly gets itchy and dry.\n",
            "Used my whole pregnancy and NO stretch marks!\n",
            "My girlfriend took a tumble and it tore up her knee. She's a fan of shorts and felt a bit self conscious with the scar that formed. I took a flier on this cream because it was so highly rated and it was good. A dark brown scar became less noticeable after about 2 months of applying it twice a day.\n",
            "Okay while this Bio Oil did keep my skin moisturized during my pregnancy it did not stop or prevent stretch marks at all. I applied it every day at least three times a day and started very early in my pregnancy. While i wasn't positively confident that it would prevent or improve scars or stretch marks I had some hope. If you want to pay for overpriced body oil that simply keeps your sin moisturized go for it but I would recommend just saving our money and buying coconut oil or something cheaper that does the same thing. Also the smell isn't great, while it doesn't smell terrible it doesn't smell good and it has a slightly off smell.\n",
            "I have used this product two months already, it just like the ordinary face oil, it didn’t turned out as the product description said, so I went back to check the review that rated one star , from there, a lot of people mentioned it was fake.\n",
            "I love this stuff... it has a light pleasant scent, it absorbs quickly so you don’t feel greasy and a little goes a long way. While I don’t use it on my whole face, it made my chin congested and I got a small pimple, I use it literally everywhere except my chin- everywhere. I’m 46 but my skin is softer than its ever been... stop reading and buy some, hurry up!!!\n",
            "I have only been using this product for about two weeks now and I can already see a difference in my skin. I have sensitive mostly dry skin and this has worked wonders. So far no irritation and my complexion is evening out. I have been using it mainly on areas of my face where there are dark marks. I use it after washing and toning, and before moisturizer and SPF. I would recommend for anyone looking to correct discoloration and/or dark spots.\n",
            "I heard a lot of good things about the product for acne scars. I used it one night and woke up with hives all over my face. I used to have sensitive skin when I was younger and would get hives often but I haven’t in years. But this product, from using it for one time, has given me residual painful hives all over my face for like two weeks now and I have done EVERYTHING to get rid of my hives and irritation. I have avoided using other products on my face, I use Aquaphor to reduce the dryness, I've replaced my pillow cases and washed my masks numerous times and I still can't get rid of the hives and irritation.  If you have even slightly sensitive skin I would say do not get this.\n"

We wound up having to douse her in corn starch to easy her itching and the next day we had to go to the ER. Needless to say, I recommend that you stay far away from this product.\n",
            "I was a little skeptical when I first purchased this oil but it honestly works so well. I’ve been using 1 drop of it every day on a scar that I’ve had for about 2 years now. The scar is still visible but it is not as noticeable and it is much softer. I would totally recommend this product. This product also lasts a LONG time. Totally worth every penny!\n",
            "I love the scent of this oil and I love that it does moisturize your skin but not anything heavy. I don't see any improvements in my scars, like fading away old scars or stretch marks.  Also I read instructions that you should use it twice a day and I don't. Ambi fade cream works better. I just hate the smell. But I may purchase bioOil again, just because I like that it moisturizes my skin and leaves a shine, along with the fact that it smells good.\n",
            "I absolutely love this product. I ordered it after I saw a commercial advertising it. I have really bad stretch marks from my first pregnancy 12 years ago and nothing has really helped. This product has made such a difference for me and my self confidence. Of course it did not make them go away, but it did lighten them to a faint pink color and with a little sun on my skin they blend it and are hardly visible. I now also use it on my face and body to even out skin tone and recently applied it to a sunburn and it worked wonders. This is my favorite product I am using right now and I order it every month!\n",
            "It does not have a scent, and absorbs quickly!\n",
            "I bought this because of the reviews, I'm using it on my scars, and so far I don't notice any difference but it is way too soon to tell.  It does absorb well and my skin is softer where I use it so it's worth it.  I've used it on my very dry face, and found it really feels good and works! A tiny bit is all you need.\n",
            "It’s an ok oil so far only been using a few days now. I got the oil to help with scars on my body because I read that’s what it was good for. My first impression of the oil was the smell wasn’t that appealing to my taste. My skin didn’t absorb it fast which left me feeling moisturized longe. I did not have have any bad reactions to it so so far so good.\n",
            "Great quality. I would order again.\n",
            "I found that sunburns heal almost overnight with this oil! It's very good for moisturizing skin. The scent can be a bit heavy if you are planning to wear perfume. It's pricey, but lasts a long time. Not greasy in feel but since it's an oil, you do need to let it soak in before you can move about without transfer.\n",
            "If you read some of the other reviews about them being sent a fake product, I don't believe they are doing that anymore. I received an authentic bio oil and it seems that most people who ordered in 2020 have gotten the same. Used it last night, so good so far.\n",

The only thing I hate is the application. It's almost impossible to apply this to any part of my body without getting oil on the bottle, and then wherever I set the bottle there's an oil ring when I pick it up next time. It's a bit of a mess!\n",

Only good thing is this does not cause any allergy or make the scar worse.  I am not happy with it since I spend so much time try to chase my son to put it on everyday!  Very Disappointed!!!  Really wish it worked...\n",
            "After 6 days of use I developed a red, hot, itchy rash on my belly, hips, and breasts. I should have known better with something that smells SO chemically, but I was tricked into a false sense of safety by $&@#ing instagram influencers. Lesson learned. This is like spreading toxic oil spill directly on your skin. I do not normally have sensitive skin and have never reacted like this to a skincare product.\n",
            "Great for stretch marks, blemishes, and damaged skin. Doesn't feel too oily either and smells pleasant.  Softens my skin as well.\n",
            "I had breast implants a few months ago, been using this per many recommendations to minimize stretch marks. I’ve used it prior to getting implants too and it makes your skin look hot & moisturized. You know those ladies who have like perfect looking moisturized and not to shiny legs this does that! Worth it. You’ll be feeling fly and hot as hell!\n",
            "AMAZING!!! Scars, stretch marks (even purple deep ones), and blemishes have disappeared!!Smells like cinnamon.Ignore the fake product reviews that must be for another one with a cheaper price.This stuff works miracles!\n",
            "I was a little nervous to buy this product since multiple people had reported it as a fake. That was not my experience. What I received matches the picture and a previous bottle I have. Scent is the same too. I love this oil - it’s very moisturizing and easy to apply (bottle doesn’t let it spill all over). I’m just over 4 months pregnant, so have a bump but not a lot of stretch yet. I can’t comment on its effectiveness in that department, but at least I feel like I’m going to prevent those stretch marks!\n",
            "Good\n",
            "Great oil mixture for scars or eczema it seems as winter approaches. Excited to see if this helps with my scars but so far extremely moisturing and the smell is very light \"old lady\" floral perfume scented but it's not very noticable and almost all oils will have a scent. The scent doesn't bother me enough to not give this a shot like others complain about in the comments.\n",

It absorbs into the skin so well I JSU be careful not to put too much a little works well and after it absorbs I put a little lotion but it’s not really needed.

            "I was skeptical to order this off of amazon bc  I saw many reviews that received fake products but I ordered anyway and I got the original! It works so well on my stretch marks and dark spots anywhere on my body. My stretch marks have been fading and I started using it for my dark circles too! Smells good too but it’s a little powerful for me if I use too much. It’s so moisturizing  I use it before I go to bed and wake up Very moisturized.\n",
            "I have combination skin and it's been so hard to manage. Every moisturizer I would use wouldn't moisturize my dry patches and would leave the oily parts of my skin even worse than it started. This stuff changed my life. My face is consistently hydrated and it takes away all of the oiliness. It smells wonderful and leaves your skin very soft. I've also noticed significant difference in my scars. I've only been using it for a week and it has already worked wonders. If you have combination skin, this is a great product to add to your skin care routine. I can't speak for other skin types, though.\n",
            "Got this for my breast augmentation surgery since I was scared of getting stretch marks & I heard that the stretched out skin gets itchy after surgery.... and this has soothed my skin SO MUCH. It has a funny smell like the Mederma stretch mark oil but that doesn’t bother me. It is really good at calming down irritated skin!\n",
            "I ordered this product because I had a severe burn on my hand and it took almost two months to heal however there was no scarring which is exactly what the product claims to do.  It works and is very reasonably priced.\n",

I read a few reviews stating that the product was not the same but trusted my past experience.  Unfortunately, it has changed.  in the past, BioOil always left my skin bright and full of moisture.Im not sure what has changed but when i use it my skin looks dry and ashy and feels dry to the touch.  I am sad to say i need to find a different oil and I'm returning this one.  SO SO Disappointed\n"

On my hips, it seems like it has just lightened my stretch marks, but on my face, applying this before bed seems to have really helped me with my acne scars. It has also helped my sensitive skin with redness and uneven skin tone without clogging my pores or making me break out. If you combine this with a chemical exfoliant and a vitamin c serum, consider your acne scars gone in a few weeks!\n",

I use this mostly in the winter on my inner thighs, ankles and shoulders where I seem to get dry skin the most. I've put this on my hands at night time to help with cracked knuckles and I was pleased with the results. This is a good body oil to have on hand. The scent is \"clean\" to me... I don't mind it.\n",

I was late to use this after pregnancy, but I'm confident in this product. Smells great, feels pampering. Im glad its on amazon.This same product is $28-29 at stores like CVS and Walgreens. Glad i found it here.\n",
            "This definitely makes my skin softer and takes away some of the rough areas. I didn't give a 5 star (yet at least) since I'm still figuring out how well it works on scars. I had a recently new scar on my hand I was testing it on and since I can still see it after a couple months, it's still kind of debatable. Will say I don't use it the two times a day, but I've been using it for the past couple of months once a day. I can definitely tell when I forget to put it on as my rough spots are a little rougher the next day. So it will definitely help your hands and skin feel softer.\n",
            "I love this product. I'm a first time mom and I've used it my whole pregnancy. It's kept my skin soft and I've not had ANY stretch marks. Pre-pregnancy I was 125 lbs and I've gained about 30 lbs and I'm in my 7th month. I would highly recommend this product to a friend and I actually bought this for my friend who is 2 weeks behind me in her pregnancy. It's kept me from itching when my skin is stretching. I'm going to keep using it post-partum as well. I put it on my belly, breasts, back, and bottom after I dry off from the shower.

I also did not enjoy the smell - its weird and strong\n",

One other product I suggest pairing this with Vital Proteins Collagen Peptides, an oral supplement of collagen which helps with skin elasticity. Note that not all collagen supplements are pregnancy safe (i.e. Marine collagen is not) Here's what I take: https://amzn.to/2tyiX5v\n",
            "I had spots on both legs where I'd run into corners of furniture or something and there was a red mark that never went away. I guess they were scars. I don't even know. They weren't scabs. Anywho, I slathered some oil on both legs last night after a bubble bath and then toweled them off a bit because it was a little sticky, and went to bed. This morning, those spots that have been there for maybe a year are almost gone! Your results may not be the same, but, I can hardly believe the difference. I'm putting some more on right now. It's miraculous. I usually can't stand feeling sticky, but, firstly, it's not that sticky, and secondly, totally worth it for these results.\n",
            "I started using this product immediately after giving birth and holy cow I can’t believe the improvements. It doesn’t work overnight, it takes time, but I am 9 weeks postpartum and these are my results. I will continue to use this everyday!It has a good scent and is super easy to use.\n",

            "Smells like the regular chapstick which I love.  Very moisturizing. Not sure if it made a difference in my skin but I like it as basic winter go to for hands, elbows, neck and chest.  I have very sensitive skin and stopped putting on my face r/t greasy feel & no improvement in facial skin.\n",
            "I know a lot of people love this oil, but I find it to thick for my skin, it doesn't absorb as well as other oils I've used. It feels like it's just sitting on my face with this lingering fragrance. I also find it a bit greasy, you will need to clean your phone screen and wash your hands if you touch your face a lot.\n",
            "Used this right after pregnancy, only a few times a week, and it actually improved the look of the strech marks WAY more than I thought it would. Everyones different, but I would highly recommend giving this a try as im sure it would work some serious miracles when used as directed! Alsooo, it absorbs very well into your skin so you dont have to worry abouy it getting onto your clothing and staining it!\n",
            "I love this stuff! I first bought this 5-6 years ago in South Africa, where Bio-Oil is made. I am so glad it is now sold everywhere. It smells amazing, but not too strong (I am extremely sensitive to smell). I use it in small amounts all over my body, for scars, stretch marks, dry skin, and uneven skin tone.\n",
            "I have been using Bio-Oil for about two weeks now. Not long enough to notice any big improvements but my complexion does look smoother. I apply after my toner. A small amount goes a long way. 2-3 drops covers my face and neck. Very light oil with a light scent. Absorbs well and leaves skin a little glowy. I sometimes use an additional light moisturizer on top (clinique moisture surge). My skin is sensitive, hyperpigment, acne-prone. I have not experienced any negative reactions to the use of this product. I would recommend.\n"

I had read many suggestions to use it for easing stretch marks during pregnancy... those suggestions were wrong.  It did nothing for the itching and stretching irritation, even with numerous applications.  Wish I wouldn't have wasted my money on it.\n",
            "Wanted to love this but I don’t like how this oil doesn’t dry down for a long time. I know with an oil that is to be expected but if you are using this for pregnancy stretch marks that means not putting on clothes for a while unless you are okay with it getting on everything. That being said, I do still use this from time to time because I really like the smell and how it feels to apply.\n",
            "I love the was it keeps my belly moisturized along the day, I put the oil at 6:30am and get back home at 5:00pm and the belly is still moistured. The scent is great since it is not a very strong one. I’m very white and mu skin is very sensitive to anything very scented and this is the only oil that has covered all my specs. This is the second one I have ordered and will keep on reordering.\n",
            "So far so good. I've been using to attempt to reduce stretch marks during pregnancy and this far it seems well enough. It does however clump together if used with anything else such as lotion so don't try to double up on moisturizer lol. The scent reminds me of a bar of dial soap.\n",
            "I really really wanted to love it. I have very fair, sensitive and dry skin, as well as stretch marks and awful body acne scars. I had some itching with the first use but I kept using it a day and a half longer until unfortunately the itching got really intense and I ended up developing a very itchy, badly  irritated red rash everywhere I had used it. I’m not sure what, but obviously I my body does not like an ingredient or something that is in this. I think it would have been a great product  if I could have used it though.\n",
            "I love the smell of this oil. A little goes a long way. I use it as soon as I get out of the shower. I found this at the end of my last pregnancy and it definitely help reduce the look of my stretch marks after I started using it. I am using it with my current pregnancy and I have four weeks left until I deliver and I have not had any new stretch marks. This product is wonderful and I would highly recommend it.\n",
            "I was excited to receive this item to begin including it in my skincare regimen. Package arrive in a standard Amazon cardboard box with other liquid beauty supplies. All other supplies were secure with vacuumed sealed safety wrap, except Bio-Oil which arrived with no seal and box open. Although the product did not spill or otherwise appeared to be defective, I am unwilling to use. I will probably attempt to buy somewhere else.\n",
            "I think its original, I bough same one in New Zealand from a store and this one works, smells, looks and acts exactly the same. I use it mostly for my face as a moisturizer during nights or after I sunburn, as I cant stand cold greasy creams on my face. Never had skin rashes, pimples or other problem apearing after using this oil as some other products causes on my very sensitive skin. My face freckles kind of dissapeared as well. Now using it even for my fresh surgery scars. Lets see in a few weeks. Scent is soft and pleasent, like that smell honestly. Definitelly recommend.\n",
            "I have sensitive skin, doesn’t have a strong smell but definitely worked great. I did have one issue with using it for stretch marks so if you have stretch marks in a closed area like your stomach or butt, wear loose fit clothing because it can cause boils or cysts because it cannot breath.\n",

So I took a chance and wow I am impressed. I have extremely sensitive skin and skin conditions. So the fact that I have not had an issue in reacting is a plus, also I have seen great improvements in stretch mark pigmentation and their size as well. A little goes a long way since it’s oil based and I only use mine once or every other day. I will purchase again in the future.\n",
            "I wanted to try out this product because it had so many great reviews on balancing any discoloration on the face and helping fade acne scars. This product is something that will be in my face washing AM & PM routine for good now. Not only has it done both of the things that I bought it for, but it also helped my oily face be less oily as well as it's helped lower my adult acne (both in size and in frequency). It sounds like putting on an oil shouldn't do that- but that's exactly what it did for me. The price is great and didn't give me a skin reaction (even though I have sensitive skin). The only reason why I wouldn't give this a 5/5 is due to the smell of this. I really hate the smell- but it works so well that I will be looking past that each time I apply it.\n",
            "It is an oil of the best. I really recommend it 100%. I usually tell the truth when Amazon usually sells things that do not work, but this oil is not really the best in this if you would not spend your money to spend or throw it away;  I recommend it to you a thousand times. I love this product and it smells good and feels good on my skin?\n",
            "I have a sensitive skin and it suits me well. Skin becomes so soft after regular use of it, twice a day. I see it reduces the darkness of spots on skin. I have been using it for a little over 2 months and very happy with the product. I would recommend it to any one struggling with any spot on skin. I don't see them going away yet but improvement is significant. It cleanses the skin.\n",

Combined with DHC cleansing oil and pore milk, this is a good regimen for a person with psoriasis and eczema on their face. Regular creams just don’t do anything and smell so strong.

I was searching for a product that would hydrate the skin before the next session.  I thought I would try this product.It feels like a thinner baby oil and does soak into the skin well.  The only problem I have with the product is the smell (I can't even use the word fragrance).  It smells like roses and I don't care for that artificial odour.  I love roses but the manufactured smell doesn't compare IMHO.I continue to use the product but put another cream over top to mask the odour.  Now I'm calling it an odour (it's graduated from smell)So I'm not sure if the product or the combination of products is working.But hey, it's less than $20 with eligible free shipping when combined with other products and the bottle will last a long time.  Perhaps you won't mind the smell.\n",

            "The first time I bought it, it was for some stretch marks, and I don't even remember if it worked for that. The only thing I remember was that it moisturized my neck and decollete so well that it gave them a pretty sheen like I came from the beach!\n",

            "You have to be consistent with this product everyday to see results. Of course genetics will be the number one factor in stretch marks but applying this product liberally has been so helpful.I used this before I was pregnant and everyday during my pregnancy and any purple marks I had would disappear as long as I kept applying the oil.\n",
            "This oil is supposed to minimize scars and I’ve been using it  for about three months now. I had banged my shin badly on a marble shelf and was hoping it would help the healing process. Once I investigated the ingredients and realize that the main component is mineral oil, which is engineered to keep from penetrating the skin, it made sense to me that I was not detecting any changes in my scars. Even though mineral or oil is toxic, I will continue to try to use it on the small space to prove myself wrong and hope that it will take away this ugly blemish on my shin. If I remember I’ll come back and update my review but for now, no change.\n",
            "This is one of the few things that will bring relief from itching when my husband's eczema gets really bad.  He just puts a little in his bath for allover relief.  I've use it as a burn treatment.  This stuff just seems to be good on your skin period.\n",
            "I'm still early on in my pregnancy (less than halfway there) but it seems to be working in the sense that it moisturizes my skin. I don't see a vast improvement in the appearance of existing scars and it doesn't seem to help much with the itching. It also smells just like Dial soap and the fragrance is off putting to a pregnant woman (in my experience). This was recommended to me by another mom friend and I will continue to use it until I run out, but I don't think I will be repurchasing this.\n",
            "I love the sent. Subtle, fresh, clean. Not sure if it did anything for my stretch marks(they're old and apparently this works best on new scars) but I enjoyed using this as a daily moisturizer. Did not last long though and it was sold out when I went to repurchase 😑. I wish you could get a bigger bottle because it is easy to use thos fast especially if you'll be usinv morning and night.\n",
            "I can’t even tell you how many times I’ve ordered this 😭 MY HOLY GRAIL!!!! It REALLY helps with stretch marks. It’s so moisturizing that it makes my skin smile. My stretch marks faded as soon as I started using this. After my first baby, my stretch marks were very noticeable but I swear that when I started using this it made them almost disappear. Well they’re still there of course it’s not some magic eraser but it definitely helped them look less noticeable by taking away the purple and pink in them. I’m pregnant with my second baby and I have used this since even before I found out cause I will continue to use this every day on my skin. My belly is super moisturized and I haven’t had a single stretch mark. I’m 7 months pregnant and this is working great so far! HIGHLY recommend.\n",
            "So I wasn’t sure about how this would work on stretch marks but it has done a lot. I don’t use it consistently but at least weekly and since February my stretch marks have faded a lot more than I realized until I looked back at the picture. So happy.\n",
            "I originally bought this to try and fade some acne scars. But I keep using it because it is actually preventing the acne in the first place!\n",
            "I really wanted to believe this would work on my scar.  It’s left from Mohs surgery on my nose. Haven’t had this product but a couple of days so I can’t determine whether it actually works. What I do know, is that it has a very strong fragrance that unfortunately I’m allergic to. So, I guess I will never know if it would work. If you don’t have sensitivities to fragrance and it has worked for you, I would really like to know. Will keep trying to find something else without the unpleasant fragrance.\n"

            "When I received this in the mail it seemed to be fine from the outside amazon package but once I cut the package open it was another story. The Bio oil box seal was ripped open and when I pulled the bottle out there was no seal. Listen, this stuff costs nearly the same at Walmart and I am NOT going to put this on any skin.How do I know what's in it? How do I know it's safe? RETURNING asap. Save your time, save your money\n",

            "Love this oil and it came perfectly\n",
            "I had used this product intermittently for a long time and mostly just enjoyed how my skin felt after using it (very moisturized). When I started using it at its recommended rate (twice everyday), I noticed a HUGE difference in existing scars on my knees that were previously \"bumpy\" and somewhat painful. They are basically the same height as the rest of my skin and it's great! Additionally, I've been using it every day for pregnancy and am about 30 weeks with no stretch marks!\n",
            "This product from Amazon does not seem to to genuine.Bought genuine one  from Walmart. The original one smells better and differs slightly in color.\n",
            "Love, love, love Bio-Oil!! Used it religiously through my first pregnancy and never got a stretch mark until 36 weeks when I thought I was young with great skin and didn't need it. I stopped using it and the stretch marks came within in weeks. After my birth I began using it regularly and significantly reduced the stretch marks that could have been prevented if I just finished my pregnancy with Bio-Oil!\n",
            "My body seems to soak this product up which is a good thing because the oil does get all over my clothes. I’m not a huge fan of the scent, it’s not terrible it’s just not my favorite. I started using this towards the end of my pregnancy and I definitely felt like my skin felt moisturized. It didn’t prevent stretch marks all together but who knows how many more I could have had without using this I still use it to see if it will fade them at all.  Not seeing much of different 2.5 months post partly but I enjoy the moisture so I will continue to use.\n",
            "I  use this on my arms and legs and it soaks in very well, it leaves my skin with a dewy, glowy look.  My brother uses this and nothing else on his face for his skin which is fair and dry.  I've tried using it on my dry, acne prone skin and I don't really like it as a cleanser myself, but do use it as an eye makeup remover.\n",

I have scars in my t-zone from picking at pimples from when I was in high school and they’re definitely not as noticeable. Two. Days. TWO, so i can’t wait to see how my skin turns out after continued use! 10/10 recommend\n",
            "It’s recommended to start on your 2nd trimester but I recommend you to start it even earlier. I started to use it at the begging of my 3rd trimester when I already had the stretch marks. It was late but not too late.  I saw one new mark showed up when I started to use it. After one month, that one new mark was gone and no more new marks! My tummy skin became so much smoother. I haven’t seen a great progress of the old marks I already had tho, but it felt much better using it. Will keep using it day and night, and hopefully it will help with my old marks.\n",
            "I bought for an upcoming surgery based on YouTube vloggers that showed their scars after surgery. I used some on my hand to get an idea of what it’s like.  It’s lightly scented, and doesn’t leave your skin greasy. It was easy to rub in and didn’t leave a stain or otherwise effect my clothing.  It’s thick but soft and satiny. Oh, I literally had to put the back of my hand to my nose to smell it, so if you are concerned with scent, don’t be!\n",
            "I was bit by a brown recluse and my arm turned purple and had a ring around it. I was desperate to find something to help the area stay moist so it would not dry out and hurt and also to help not have a huge scar or hole in my arm from the bite.  I found Bio-Oil and it helped with the pain and scarring. You can't even tell where the bite is now. Amazing stuff!!\n",
            "I use this oil at nighttime- moisturizes and I do not feel itchy one bit. Ha also helped with scarring that I have on my abdomen and help prevent/treat stretch marks. The scent is pleasant don’t mind it all. Does not stain my clothes either-will continue to purchase.\n",
            "I purchased this skincare oil because I have some scarring and dark spots on my neck that I would like to fade. However, after a good amount of use, I did not see that many results from it. I will keep on trying it out and will see if time will allow for me to see greater results.\n",

I've also used it on my skin to make it more evenly and on my scars in hopes of fading but have yet to see results. 4 stars because I still have hope and although it's oily, it isn't messy.\n",
            "I LOVE this oil I’ve used it before on some bad scars I had and it works so well with consistent use. Depending on the humidity and how dry your skin is it can sometimes take a little bit to dry, but I’ve put clothes on over before it was completely dry and it didn’t get my clothes all oily and gross and still moisturized my skin to perfection. It also has a mild, clean smell that I really enjoy.\n",
            "I bought the 2 oz bottle for my first time purchase.  I love how light the oil is and how quickly it absorbs into the skin.  The quick absorption is important for me because I don't have much time to wait around before getting dressed.  It smells nice, though I think the smell is slightly masculine.  I can't pinpoint the exact scent, but it is slightly almond-like.  I've been using it twice a day beginning of my 2nd trimester as instructed.  I've gone through almost 1/4 of the bottle in a couple of weeks.  I plan on making another purchase for the remainder of my pregnancy, I'll get a larger size next time.\n",
            "The best! I wish I had started using this sooner- I always thought it was just for pregnancy. I use it all over my body, including face. Love the scent and is extra moisturing without feeling greasy. It always feels like a treat to put this on after a shower!\n",
            "It left my skin feeling like there was a thick layer of oil on it no matter how little I put on. Yes, I know it’s an oil but it was greasy like cooking oil. Didn’t like the scent much and it came to irritate my skin if I used it on my face at all.\n",
            "My mom and I have been using this product for about a month. Stretch marks are fading and the ones on my arms are all but gone. Miracle I love it I put it on my butt, arms, stomach, breast...anywear I particularly want scar free.It is now apart of my daily routine! Can’t say enough good about this place me and my mom love it!\n",
            "I've recently undergone back surgery, and the scar is horrific. I tried using other popular creams, but I would start itching within a few days. Bio-oil is awesome! No allergic reaction, no itching, and has lightened my scar and makes my skin feel soft and healthy! I will be a repeat customer! I highly recommend this product!\n",
            "I love this stuff! I feel so smooth in the morning after I use it. I was worried that I would feel too oily or it would get on my sheets and clothes, but that doesn't happen at all with this stuff. In the morning there's no oily residue and it hasn't stained anything. My dad told me it smells a bit like vicks vapo rub, so if you hate that smell, don't get this, but I don't mind the smell.\n",
            "My daughter has horrible eczema and this oil calms the \"fire\" as she calls it. It glides right on and soothes her skin.I've also put it on my recent sun burn and it took the sting right out.I absolutely recommend this oil!!\n",
            "I ordered two 2oz bottles of BioOil and this is how they arrived. I’m not sure if this is a packaging issue (like the boxes flex and commonly fall apart), or if someone opened these previously. It definitely doesn’t make me feel confident in the product or the strength/components of it. Anyone else have this issue??\n"

I tried so many different home remedies to get rid of my scars bc I was really insecure about it until my friend recommended me this. It’s a plus that it literally leaves my skin glowing in the morning.Update: I’ve been using this for 2 years now and I use it every single morning and night on my face. It also really helps with stretch marks so I’ll use them on my thighs before bed but you have to apply it everyday to see a difference in your. I also have some bad scarring on my leg from a bike accident and it definitely made a huge difference!\n",
            "I ignored the bad reviews, hoping the product was legitimate. NOPE! The box arrived ripped on the side and with the seal already broken. Smelled differently than my regular bio oil as well. Shame on Amazon for allowing bad product to continue to be sold! Stay away!\n",
            "Used it for a while to prevent stretch marks during my pregnancy. I like it and to me it smells fine. Im sure without it my stretch marks would have been worse (I only have a few and not too bad at all), but I will say before this product, I was using coconut oil as often as possible and no stretch marks had appeared yet. When I started using bio-oil I stopped using the coconut oil and a few weeks in, stretch marks appeared. I'm not sure if it was because I was getting bigger or if the coconut oil helped my skin more than this product. Either way I still have half a bottle left and I will continue to use it in hopes it will make my stretch marks less visible. If so I will update my review. Hope this helps.\n",
            "The love the fragrance.  Goes on oily, but doesn't leave skin greasy or oily.  Very satisfied with the results.  Had hip replacement in May 2020.  Wish I had known about this then.\n",
            "This is a must for me for when I’m having skin issues especially for my eczema. You just need to be very patient to see results but it will definitely lighten up dark spots or for me personally, if I apply this right away to new scars, I noticed that it will be completely gone in weeks. This is actually second bottle.\n",
            "I'm fairly certain this is a counterfeit product. The box was damaged and not sealed, and it even says \"Do Not Use Product if Seal is Broken\". I'm pretty disappointed as I was hoping to use this on facial scars from a recent dog attack.\n",
            "I've been using bio oil on my face for 5 yrs now. I use it now in place of facial moisturizer. I usually clean my face with water and a wash cloth. I apply Bio oil after washing, or showering. After it absorbs, I apply my Foundation makeup like usual. I feel like it helps with age spots, scarring, blemishes, and wrinkles. It has been great. The only thing I don't like is the light smell. And this new bottle, I just got, smells like maybe the formula has changed, because the smell is a little stronger this time. It's not my favorite, but something I know I will get used to.\n",
            "Love the smell!! Easy to use and is recommended in a lot of blogs/videos when you look up how to treat damaged skin or stretch marks. I’ve lost a significant amount of weight and I’m trying to take better care of my skin. This product is great and affordable and works great with other skin care products.\n",

I haven't noticed much of a difference yet but, I'm going to keep using this.  I'll update my review laterm\n",
            "This has been one of favorite skin products for years now. It's helped the look of my stretch marks signficantly, it helps with the texture and redness and they are barely noticeable anymore. It helps so much with acne marks and scars on my legs, I put it on when I get razor burn to prevent hyperpigmentation. I wear it to bed but it's light enough to wear during the day. It's fragrant but not overwhelming, smells like lavender and rosemary to me.\n",

It is very watery as well compared to the one from Walgreens . Go to a store and buy the real thing !\n",

I was really looking forward to this helping me out with some scars etc. I thought it'd work much better & for how long I've been using it.... Idk, if I'm doing something wrong... I follow directions. Etc. Idk, I'll cont. Ato use it & see what happens......\n",

I know this product well and that is why I am a long time customer. I usually buy this at my Walmart store, but now I am shopping from #Amazon because I need large sizes now.\n",
            "This product is simply amazing.  I have very sensitive skin and I'm currently pregnant.  All my stretch zone areas were itchy and driving me crazy until I started using this.  I put it on every night before I go to bed.  My skin is so soft and not itchy at all.  I try to remember to put it on in the morning too, but I'm usually in such a rush that I forget.  I read somewhere that this is what Princess Kate used and she didn't get any stretch marks.  I'm 30 weeks pregnant and I don't have any new stretch marks, only old ones that have kind of showed up a little more prominently.\n",
            "I use this product for my growing belly to avoid stretch marks. It's not oily and doesn't feel sticky like other oil product and I really love the feel and texture of it. The scent is so nice. Would be nice if this product is more clean or organic.\n",
            "I have severely dry skin (face) and this is \"it\" for me. Feels great, soaks in, smells divine. I think it is really helping my dry skin. I don't like to use a bunch of stuff, am a pretty low maintenance gal, and this - combined with a few drops of Vitamin C - seems to be the golden ticket for me. Give it a try! I even rub any leftover on my hands through my hair. xoxo\n",

Im 2 weeks away from being 9 months pregnant and I havent gotten a single stretch mark yet. my sister in law told me this is what she used so thats why I got it cuz she only has ONE stretch mark from each pregnancy so so far she only have 2 marks per her two pregnancies.\n"

I have very sensitive skin and it does not irritate it at all (in fact, has often helped sensitive patches). It soaks in fairly quickly for an oil in my opinion. I don’t love the scent but it is very mild and the benefits far outweigh the need for a scent.\n",
            "I used this in conjunction with Burt's Bees Belly Butter. This oil was recommended to me by a friend that used it during her pregnancy. I started using it around 24 weeks pregnant and I am now 28 weeks. Personally, I despise oily things on my skin, but I was hoping this would be worth using to prevent from getting stretch marks. Sadly, while it does make skin feel soft, I ended up developing stretch marks during this time. When I started I didn't have any. Maybe if I had started using it earlier this wouldnt have happened?\n",

            "This product doesn’t help get rid of scars. I watched a video promoting it so I said I should give it a try. I don’t see how the ingredients would help and overall wouldn’t recommend.\n",
            "I have been using this on my legs in hopes to lighten scarring from years of trichotillomaina. I use it once in the morning and wear socks over the application and again in the evening before bed. It has done a good job of lightening the older scars and keeping the skin and current scabs soft. It's embarrassing to live with the scars and red, angry marks but this has been doing a good job clearing it up for me. I am almost done with two weeks of daily application and I am looking forward to springtime when I can expose my legs with less shame and less scarring. I would recommend this to anyone suffering from self conscious scarring looking for an answer to clearing up their skin.\n",
            "I've had a long history with bio oil for scars and stretch marks. This product works magic when it comes to that. I use it everyday and it definitely pays off. It is on the expensive side but I would buy it over and over again. I've told my friends who got pregnant to use this and all of them have only good things to say about this product.\n",
            "I bought this during both of my pregnancies. I started using this during my second trimester like the bottle suggested, but unfortunately I still got a few stretch marks at 8 1/2 months pregnant. Everywhere I've heard, stretch marks are genetic and are inevitable no matter what you use. So I can't really speak too negatively of this product as I don't think any product would have completely prevented them.That being said I still like this product. My skin got really itchy while pregnant and using this definitely helped and made my skin feel so soft. Yes, it's pricey, but for me it lasted a  long time. I had plenty left after pregnancy and still continued to use them on stretch marks to help fade them. After awhile you could barely see them anymore.\n",
            "I would recommend this to anyone pregnant.  I heard about this from friends who praised its effects.  I lathered this on multiple times per day and, even after gaining 50 lbs during pregnancy, walked away with zero stretch marks.\n",
            "I think this product is okay. The instructions say to apply twice a day for 3 months to see results. I’ve been applying twice a day for about 2 weeks and think I can tell a slight improvement in the stretch marks. However, the bottle is almost gone and will like only last another week. It is VERY messy, it takes a long time to absorb into your skin and leave residue all over the bathroom counter. The product may work long term but to me wasn’t worth the mess. I will not be ordering again, wouldn’t recommend.\n",
            "I have really sensitive skin, Ive been usingthis oil since my second trimester as instructed, and its been wonderful. Im currently 36 weeks pregnant and I don't even have 1 stretch mark in my belly, compared to other places where I haven't been using the oil. This is my second bottle and I can definitely see the changes in my current stretch mark as well, they are fading.. I hope they keep fading.\n",

It’s been a week and a half since I stopped using it and the rash has finally went away but still itches pretty bad.

I apply the oil almost every day and after two weeks there was a major difference. I did notice if you stop using it for a while they will come back but not as dark, so I recommend to keep using it. Bio oil smells nice but it is pretty heavily scented, also it takes a few minutes to dry. I still love it though\n",

            "Amazing! Struggled with acne for a while and I was left with bad scars on my cheeks but everything I’ve tried made me breakout. I never felt comfortable in public without makeup. I’ve only been using bio-oil for 1.5 months and my scars and skin have improved so much. I can finally go in public without makeup and it has even improved the terrible bagS under my eyes. Highly recommend for people with sensitive skin.\n",

It has a good smell , I instantly had nostalgia when I smelled it because I knew I had used this when I was younger . I’m not sure if it supports sensitive skin but you can always research it . Definitely recommend this product as a moisturizer\n",
            "I've been using this for a few months and see no difference in my stretch marks and skin. It just doesn't seem to work for me. It might work for others. Everyone is different. It has a very weird smell to it and I'm not really happy with it.\n",
            "Light clean scent to this body oil.  Excellent for scars.  It erases the look of dark scars.  It does not happen overnight but diligent use twice a day and you will begin to see a difference in 3 weeks.  By 3 months time there is a significant difference.  Highly recommend this product!\n"

            "The \"holy grail\" product to prevent pregnancy stretch marks so I bought this as soon as I found out.  I purchased this along with the Burt's Bees Mamma Bee Belly Butter.  I have enjoyed using both together or separate depending on how I was feeling that day before bed.  The Bio Oil really absorbs quickly into the skin so you dont have to worry too much but I also use a small amount so its not messy.  I also love the fragrance.\n",
            "I'm 27 and still struggling with acne and the scarring that comes with it. After one use of this over night I was pretty shocked the next day, my skin texture and acne itself looked noticeably better. It's now been only three days since I've been using this before bed time and I'm just amazed how clear, how soft, and how it's less oily my skin is throughout the day. Only slightly negative thing is I'm just not crazy about the smell, reminds me of an older ladies perfume because of the rose in it. Regardless this stuff is awesome and cant wait to see the out come of using it long term!\n",
            "LOVE the smell of this stuff. It smells like I just got through a day at a luxury spa. It really helps me sleep (the smell alone). It goes on smooth, love the consistency of this stuff and that it doesn't leave you goopy at all. Using it for all the intended purposes....i hear all good things about it, but i'll use it for the moisturizing benefits and the smell alone even if it doesn't work on any of my marks.\n",
            "I have to be honest. I’m not a big fan of BioOil. I used it once and decided to use coconut oil instead for scar treatment. It soaks in nicely and didn’t leave me feeling like a greaseball. I just prefer to use more natural products. I’m also not sure about the safety of this product. I’ve read so many conflicting studies and reviews so I just don’t feel comfortable using it.\n",
            "Ive been using this since the first week of my second trimester. Im now 7.5 months pregnant and I dont have a single stretch mark. I LOVE this product.It says to use twice a day but I only put it on at night before bed because it is a little oily but 100% does the trick.\n",
            "Used this thru both my pregnancies and did not get any stretch marks! I am prone to scaring and stretch marks and this really works. I love that it doesn’t leave any oil on your clothes and leaves you feeling soft and not greasy.\n",
            "rich oil that disappears quickly, in process of using it on scares on my palms, but smells like cinammon and hot sause. dont see results as yet as described on label, its been a month,will keep trying,\n",
            "Smells great and absorbed fast. I have sensitive skin and use it as a face moisturizer, on scars and stretch marks. I bought a small bottle of this to see if I like it and in two weeks I could tell a slight difference so I bought a bigger bottle.\n",
            "This body oil absorbs quickly and is hydrating. I haven't been using it long enough to write a review about how effective this is on stretch marks, but I will update my review once I know. Hope this was helpful.\n",

Since it worked so well, I tried it on some scars from a leg surgery and has greatly reduced them as well and have lightened them up.  I continue to use it because it helps my skin stay so soft and the smell is great and not so over powering and is very light.\n",

Lasts a while, totally worth the money. I also have very sensitive skin and this did not harm me one bit it just helped me. I will forever purchase this product.

I used it everywhere as I know women who had stretch marks on other areas of their bodies due to weight gain in pregnancy. I only had two small regions of stretch marks on my lower abdomen (thankful). Now, the stretch marks are close to my skin tone. Maybe it is nature, but I feel like this works. I don’t like the smell, but it doesn’t last. It is an oil, but the product was usually already absorbed in my skin before I put on my clothes.\n",
            "I guess this product is mainly used to reduce the appearance of scars - I didn't get it for that purpose, so perhaps it is a bit lost on me. It moisturizes well but I admit I don't like the rose scent, which lingers so I've stopped using it for my face. It absorbs well, tho.\n",
            "I wanted buy this for my granddaughter who's approaching puberty to help prevent stretch marks. I wanted to try it before I gave it away. I'm 61 & have very dry skin. I used it on my face at night after cleansing. It would be fine for me to use under a moisturizer. It's also recommended for scar treatment. I work for plastic surgeons & recently a recovered patient who's surgical scars had faded very well & quickly, stated she used it & Vit E. I think it's great for both applications. I gave the remainder of the bottle to my 12 year old granddaughter to use for scar treatments for minor cuts & scraps & told her mother to tell her to use it on her breast & hips when she started to grow in those areas during puberty. I plan to order another bottle to replace that one to keep for my cuts & scrapes, etc. It has very little scent if any & goes on the skin nicely. I would & have recommended it to others.\n",
            "I have slightly sensitive and dry skin so I was a but nervous to try this but I'm so glad I did. I use it on my face and my body and it's fantastic. A tip though - it can be a bit heavy (at least for summer) if you apply it directly from the bottle to your face so what I do is get my hands a bit damp with water (or not completely dry it after cleansing) then put it on my hands, run them together then apply.\n",
            "I had a csection 8 months ago and I use this on my scar whenever it gets itchy. It not only makes it feel immediately better, it doesn’t itch for a few days after! And my scar looks amazing. I can hardly tell that it’s there\n",
            "After plastic surgery, this oil is amazing for healing as well as softening !\n",
            "I’ve had this product for about a week and I’m hooked. I will never be without this ever again nor will I ever travel without it. The first night I had it, I lathered my post pregnancy belly with it and my face and went to bed. I woke up the next morning in complete shock. My face was glowing and I noticed a difference in my stretch marks (I also slept in a sweat belt). I honestly hate that I didn’t buy this years ago.\n",
            "I just received this item so I can’t speak for the long term results yet but this product does smell very good and it feels so moisturizing already. I’ve heard nothing but good things about this product so I will be using throughout my entire pregnancy I am currently 5 months so I’m hoping for no stretch marks at the end of it.\n",

I did use a home made mix of cocoa butter/coconut oil at night every day with it. Whatever it was, I had my baby and did not have a single stretch mark. Not sure if it was the oil, the butter mix or working out, but I didnt have any stretchmarks, and I liked how this oil felt on my skin. It wasn't greasy to stay on my clothes (i would use it after the shower in the morning, and would soak the excess with papertowell before dressing). Like the smell of it (you know how some smells irritate you during pregnancy). If I ever get pregnant again, this will be the first thing i get.\n",

I started applying this bio oil and started to see a change and fading of the marks in weeks. No, they are not gone and no they will never go away but now I am no longer self conscious of them! I occasionally use this on my face and have noticed a reduction in the appearance of acne scars.\n",
            "I bought this for a very long scar on my arm I got from an industrial oven. The scar was probably an inch or two long and just after a few weeks of using it once a day, I’m impressed!! The scar is almost gone!! I’m very happy with this product!\n",
            "I purchased this to try to fade the appearance of stretch marks in between my thighs and on my hips. I liked that it made my skin feel moisturized without being too slick. It was a nice consistency and the smell was okay. However, after about a month of use, I don't see any difference. If anything, one spot seems to have gotten darker and more obvious. The product hasn't done anything to help in the way it was intended, so pretty disappointed. I guess I'll finish the bottle, but won't be reordering.\n",

So the fact that I’m 60 pounds heavier now and still growing without a single mark is amazing. I use this twice a day now that I’m showing sometimes more if I shower in the middle of the day but I’m a firm believer in bio oil.

            "In terms of moisturizing then this product is a yes. i used it ad nights and love how it made my skin feel. It didn't afde any of my dark marks even though I used it for 3 months. I would still use it because my it evened my skin tone and made my skin texture smoother.\n",
            "LOVE this product. have been using to help reduce stretch marks with pregnancy. ofcourse i have some but its not too bad. I put it on my entire body after my shower. Usually i get eczma with the cool weather coming in but havent had any since ive been using this. Keeping my body nicely moisturized! deffinately recommend to others!\n",

            "I never thought I would put oil on my face, but I absolutely love this stuff! I have been using it almost every night and I'm seeing a huge change in my complexion as far as a much more even skin tone.  Have a also had friends use on their belly during pregnancy.\n",
            "I don’t know if it’s working yet...I’m in my second trimester so stretch marks are super common for me. But I’m committed to using it daily. My marks are super light so i don’t want to imagine what they could look like without using this oil. It has a wonderful and kind of calming scent. It’s also gentle. I bought a big bottle and am surprised that it actually lasted two months...I’m kind of heavy handed\n",

This does not make any of this things worst and I have seen a lot of my stretch marks and scars fade. I've been using for about a year. I just bought a small bottle for my sister and she's pregnant and said she loved how it absorbed in her skin and made her skin feel. I do use this in every part of my body and it works wonders for my dehydrated skin but I still do use other moisturizers with it.\n",

I use it as a moisturizer but again greasey, maybe I need to add it in with a normal moisturizer.  I  have been rubbing this on very old strectch  marks it would be a miracle if this helped.\n",
            "I had a beauty mark removed last year that left a scar, and since I’ve been using this oil - the scar is fading and smoother. I applied it twice a day every day for almost 4 months now. I’m glad Amazon had the big bottle of this. I also have sensitive skin, and it hasn’t made me break out. If anything, my skin is softer.\n",
            "On my second bottle now. I haven’t seen a different in color with the way it “heals” stretch marks, but at 8 months pregnant currently i can say my belly does not ever itch because I apply 2 times daily and it keeps my skin feeling great.\n",

            "Been using this daily, twice a day, for my pregnant belly! I love it! I feel like since I use it often it’s definitely running out fast but I love how it feels and how non greasy it is! Low scent and long lasting! It’s perfect!\n",
            "I didn't notice until later that it has mineral oil as main ingredient, which causes clogged pores and isn't good for skin. However, if you're just using it specifically for a scar somewhere, it shouldn't cause complications. I just wouldn't use on face unless you minimally mix is with another product, or even coconut oil or similar.It takes a while to work but I would suggest using it twice per day and for about 2-3 months, daily.\n"

I use it on my face even though most oils cause MAJOR breakouts. Overall, I recommend.\n",

It won’t be until 3 months so see dramatic results, just be patient. No doubt this will work. Smells great and fresh great on my skin.\n",

I used to have really bad acne but ever since i incorporated this into my skin care, i only get pimples once in a while and they go away quick thanks to this oil. The first week using this i noticed my skin was getting softer and looking glowy, after 1 month my skin just literally stop producing acne. even though i have acne scars they are fading rather quickly. The only con is that it makes your skin look oily but thats to be expected since it is oily:)\n",
            "I'm 9 months pregnant and purchased this product for stretchmarks. I was a little iffy about getting it through Amazon because of some of the reviews saying it's fake. Well, the box I recieved was tore open and there was no seal under the lid which is a huge red flag... Practically everything you buy now has a seal so that makes me nervous. I don't want to go through the hassle of returning it so I'm going to give it a try anyways and hope for the best. If you purchase this product, use caution and don't let your toddler help open the box because there may not be a seal on yours and oil isn't fun to clean up.\n",
            "Today is Tuesday, and it is the third day that I am using the oil, step in the morning, and before bed.  just perfect, I used it on my stomach before when my beautician prescribed it for me, for the treatment of stretch marks after pregnancy, and I fell in love ... it is very worth every penny.  as shown in the image, i took the first picture on saturday before using it, and the second picture i just took already to make a comparison and i'm in shock that it already gave this result in such a short time of use.  It's my right thigh.  I had to come here to show, praise and help other women find what they are looking for.  bio oil does not disappoint me.  I highly recommend it, 1000 stars! 02-04-2019 3:46\n",
            "I love this oil! I saw results fast. I was only using it once a day and saw results but it says use it twice a day. I highly recommend this oil if you want to clear up stretch marks dark marks the whole 9 yards. This works.\n"

That being said, I broke out on my arms & thighs like I’ve never seen after that using this product. Again, seems to work wonders for others but did not work for me. Hopefully, just because of my sensitivities and can work for all of you!\n",

I am 8 months pregnant and don't have ANY stretch marks... could it be genetics?.... Yes..... Could it be this oil...... Yes.... One may never know, but it's worth a shot! I also love the smell!\n",

Stretch marks or genetic so none of this stuff actually works for that and I didn't know that until after I had already purchased it. So for what I wanted it for it didn't work.\n",

            "I would say this is more of a body oil than it is a face oil. It smells like baby oil to me, very pleasant smell. My face didn’t like it, but my body loves it! I used it wherever I have stretch marks. Love the bottle, love the scent, love this for all over the body, just not face.\n",

I've heard some people complain about the smell but it smells just fine to me.  Apply before applying lotion or mix with lotions.  Use twice a day for scars or marks.  Use one a day for moisture maintenance and skin toning.\n",

The bottle itself is scratched as if someone took it and rolled it across a gravel road. Very upset by this. Scared to return, don’t want repeat.\n",

I waited to try this because it $30 everywhere else and I didn't want to spend that much if it didn't work. I wished I used this years ago. I was on steroids for 4 months and stretch marks suddenly appeared on my arms and they were the dark purple/red kind. Well I been using the product for 3 weeks twice a day but I stopped using it for about 5 days and they are disappearing. Most of them are already gone. I only have a few left.\n",

My stretch marks from my previous pregnancy seem to be less noticeable, still there of course, but less red/very light. My only regret is not buying the bigger bottle, I’m halfway through the 4 oz bottle on week 3 so not too bad!\n",

            "Love Bio-oil. It has a nice scent and isn't too greasy. The one thing I wish is that it was easier to dispense. Either I get a tiny bit or if I squeeze, too much comes out. Not that there isn't a use for more at times.The one use I like is to put it on bug bits or scratches, etc. to reduce scars and decease healing time. I add it to my face lotion occasionally and love the extra softness it gives my skin.I haven't put it on stretch marks so I can't say how it works on those for me.I put it in my body wash and turned the body wash very watery so don't do that! A little goes a long way.\n",
            "Love, love, love!!!!!! I used a belly butter with my first pregnancy and have tons of stretch marks. I am currently 32 weeks with my second and have been using the oil since 2nd trimester and haven't noticed any new stretch marks and the previous ones look a little lighter. Great scent and easy to apply.\n",
            "Alright. So I started using Bio Oil a month ago, I try to use it one, or two times a day. I use it for my face, since I'm prone to acne scars, and I've basically had them since I can remember. Bio Oil has definitely improved my scars, they are fading ever so slightly, and I can tell it takes time. But I know that when the time comes and they're officially gone it's going to be because of this product. It's \"oil\" so obviously when putting it on your skin it's gonna be greasy, I try not to put too much or if I accidentally do I just deal and let it dry on my skin before I do anything else with it. The smell is okay, it's not scented so it just smells like.. \"oil\" haha. When I use it before bed, I wake up with my skin feeling soooooooOooo soft. I love it I have dry skin, and honestly my skin has never felt this soft before. I've had it for about a month, and the bottle is STILL full. So I can tell this is definitely worth the money.In my opinion Bio Oil is amazing. I'm excited to continue using it and get the skin I've always wanted.\n",
            "I loved using Bio Oil with my first two kids, it’s been 5 years and I’m pregnant again so I ordered some and this is not the real stuff!!!! I am very picky about scents and fragrances and LOVED the way Bio Oil smelled. I put this stuff on when it arrived today and it does not smell like it used to. It smells more like old lady hand soap and the scent won’t go away. If looking for the real Bio Oil this is not it?l!!\n",
            "Omg if you haven’t tried Bio Oil you need to! I ordered it on amazon and it got to my house yesterday. After I took a shower I applied it to my growing baby belly and my chichis and it instantly felt so silky and it absorbed so well . I also applied it to my face because, between the weather and these baby hormones my face is braking out and getting extremely dry. It did feel oily when I first applied to my face but it also absorbed really well.Ok This is the best part, this morning after i woke up my face is seriously the clearest it’s been sense finding out I was pregnant! Everywhere I applied the Bio Oil feels so soft, I really feel like it’s going to help the elasticity in my skin .Thank you to all the ladies that recommended this product! It’s definitely worth trying !\n",
            "I love this product I’m just ordering my second bottle 💙💙💙💙 my skin is amazing more than before my surgery\n",
            "Im 7 months pregnant and I have been using this day and night from week 12. i also use it on my legs after shaving and so far so good! No stretch marks yet, but i have heard those usually appear at the end during rapid growth. I would still continue to use this in my bath fizz mixture regardless because it’s leaves an oil free feeling of moisture after it soaks in\n",
            "This is by far one of my favorite skin products. I’ve been using it for a year now applying only 2 drops on a thin cotton pad 3-5 minutes on my face after I get out of the shower. It has helped not only moisture my skin but help new bumps go away and heal all of the scaring on my face. I highly recommend!\n",
            "I have a big scar on my forehead due to surgery, it was still bright red three months after. I started using a foundation brush to apply it morning and night. After about 10 days I saw a huge difference!! The lines are not noticible now. I am extremely happy with this product.\n",
            "This smells so amazing. It's very moisturizing too. I haven't seen scar removal results yet after a week, but I would use it even if it never faded them, now that I've tried it.\n"

            "This will forever be in my makeup bag. I use it at night before I go to bed after I wash my face. I wake up and my face is fully moisturized. I wouldn't recommend putting it on your face in the morning just because it will make your face very oily. I am also 26 weeks pregnant and ive been applying it on my stomach morning and before bed and my stomach is so nice and smooth and no stretch marks. Highly recommend!\n",
            "I got this product hoping to fade some facial acne scars and lower body stretch marks. I have dry skin and have used many oil based products on it before. I put small amount on my chin for the scars and the next day I had acne popping up all along my jawline and an itchy rash extending down my neck as well.I will say that I used it on my stretch marks and there was no reaction - hence the second star.\n",
            "I've been using this every night on my stomach, breasts, thighs to prevent stretch marks throughout my pregnancy. I love the smell, its like a warm, spicy, luxurious fragrance. So moisturizing & smooth\n",
            "I bought the oil about a month ago when I was starting with my 3rd month of pregnancy.  Even after a month's use, I did have not seen any results.  I got them for the stretch marks on my tummy, but with the end of the 4th month, the number and strength of the stretch marks has started to increase. Overall, the oil has a good smell, but as some of the reviews say it does not necessarily work to avoid stretch marks and in my case it is not working.\n",
            "I only gave four stars because I haven’t noticed much difference on my stretch marks in the 5 weeks of continuous use after delivering my baby. I love the smell and it feel nice, also moisturizing. Just hasn’t lightened the dark stretch marks. I’ll update if that changes.\n",
            "There is simply nothing I dislike about this product! Biooil is SOOOOO good for my skin, my skin stays moisturized for hours! The reason I started using Biooil was because I have hyperpigmentation and this was recommended for me to use.. And when I did my skin became clear and its very effective the only thing is if you don't take care of your skin like your supposed to your skin isn't going to become clear as you would like it to. But I most definitely will buy again!!!!!!!!!\n",
            "So far I really love this oil. It absorbs well into my skin unlike other oils and moisturizes better than any lotions I have. I’ve only been using it for about a week so still not sure how well it really works on scars/stretch marks. The only downside is the smell is not good, but it fades pretty quickly. So if you’re not sensitive to smells I’d say buy it.\n",
            "I bought it because recently I fell and need to put something on my skin for my scar.  Still early to tell if it will help but the scent of the oil is so good that I have been putting it in my face.  It makes my skin so smooth.  So happy for it.  Another quality buy.\n",
            "I started using this product 15 years ago and after two months my acne scars and dark spots were no more. I'm using it again to remove new scars. It is greasy, so allow it to penetrate into your skin before getting dress.\n",

Also, I have oily skin in the summer, prone to breakouts, and I still use this product, it doesn't make your face extra oily -- before I started using I was nervous that it would make me break out if I use it on my face, it doesn't (at least for me)!\n",
            "LOVE this oil! Keeps skin soft and smooth. I used this on my pregnant belly after every shower and never got a stretch mark to speak of! Also works great on scars or just regular dry skin. You only need a few drops at a time, absorbs in easily.\n",

Once I received it, I compared it to the ones in stores and it seemed pretty legit. I started using this product, along with another pregnancy lotion for stretch marks. They seemed to compliment each other because I am not 38 weeks pregnant without a single one. I'm certain that this will reduce the chances of getting any stretch marks since it did ease off my irritation when I got the urge to scratch. I would just recommend you to double check that you receive the official version of Bio-Oil before using.\n",
            "I used this product during my third trimester of pregnancy and I believe it helped to reduce stretch marks! I just purchased it again in hopes that it will help to even out my skin tone on my face, so far I feel more hydrated overall even though it has not been that long. I recommend this product to anyone looking for an affordable oil to reduce scaring, stretch marks, or for basic hydration.\n",

There was one part of my scar on my upper arm that I didn't rub it on as much because and that scar is more noticeable there than the part I did use the Bio Oil on. I'm not sure what magic is in the bottle, but I am very happy with the results.\n",

It has a light fragrance, silky non greasy feel. I have read the rave reviews so I guess a lot of people got some good results but I didn't get any remarkable results. If you want a non greasy oil this will do.\n",
            "Been wanting to purchase this item at a near by market but they never had it so I resulted to Amazon.  The scent of this product is really nice and nothing citrusy (which I personally dislike).  Be careful not to over apply if using as a facial oil/moisturizer.  It absorbs well if you use the right amount and is suitable for sensitive skin with rosacea.  Overall great product!\n",
            "I’ve used this during the pregnancy. I did not like the scent at the very first time, but started to love it all of sudden. Perfect for my body moisture.\n",
            "Was recommended this product from a friend who used it for her stretch marks, so I decided to give it a try! While I dont expect miracles as my kids are now 4 and 19 months, I really do enjoy putting this oil on my stomach and giving myself a nice massage! Fingers crossed!\n",
            "I got this for my Mom after her knee replacement surgery and she said that it is really helping. Her scar is much smaller than her doctor expected and he was happy she chose this brand due to past patients having good results with it.\n",
            "This is great for scars and dark spots. It's a dry oil that doesn't leave a residue. It also smells good and will leave your skin smooth. This product will not automatically remove the scars or dark spots, but if you continuously use it, the scars or dark spots can become lighter or fade away a little. You should use this in combination of other products such as a whitening soap in order to get rid of the dark spots.\n",
            "Used daily during third pregnancy and I’m not sure if it’s this product, good luck, or because I didn’t gain as much weight this time, but I only have two small stretch marks this time. Unfortunately it did not erase my old stretch marks, but at least I don’t have the dark purple marks of past pregnancies.\n",
            "Obsessed with this (this is my second bottle)! After a week of using this my stretch marks faded significantly. I am only 11 weeks postpartum so some of that might be natural healing. It has a light and pretty smell. It can be a bit difficult to rub in/spread, but it makes my skin so soft. Sooo worth it!\n",
            "I was surprise because I’m not sure if it’s authentic. I still had some left from the bio oil I bought at target and compare to this one- this one is more orange and the smell is stronger.\n",
            "I really like seeing how much my stretch marks and scars have lightened over time with the use of the oil. I also love the feel of the oil and how it’s not too heavy. Second time buying this oil for myself and truly enjoying the results!\n",

I am happy to say that this helped stop the itching of my stretching skin and also, part this and part genetics, I have no stretch marks and my little girl is already 5 weeks old! I love this stuff!\n",

It says you should apply it in the areas of your stretch marks for at least 3 months twice daily. I have the stretch marks on both sides of my thighs and down on my calf. I've been doing it once daily (and sometimes I forget throughout the week) and I have seen great results. I've been doing this for a month now and I can already really see the stretch marks fade. I really do recommend this product.\n",
            "I was really excited to try this on my fine lines on my face. But it is def not for sensitive skin. I’ve never had acne or pimples and this have me huge cystic pimples. It worked great on my stretch marks in my other parts of my body so I continue to use it for that but wouldn’t recommend for face.\n",
            "The picture taken in the day time was exactly a month ago when I first used this product. And the one with flash is me today( a month later). It definitely lightened up my old scares that we’re a year old. Now my new scars are healing and the healing process is a lot faster with this oil. I have put it on morning and night and have only missed two days. My scars were also deep and scabbed so for them to look like this is good news to me!\n",

Great for areas prone to stretch marks and dullness (i.e breasts, décolletage, buttocks, thighs, shoulders) as well as helpful when adding a great sheen to the skin post shower and scrub.

I have only been using it for 2 weeks and I’m already starting to see results. They are not gone of course but they are not as red as they were in the beginning. I also have used it for my face for acne scars and uneven skin tone and seeing results on that already as well. I would recommend this to anyone!\n",

            "Not positive how well this works for reducing scars but it definitely reduces the itching from scars.  Three people in my household have used this product.  One has large scars from a burn, one has a scar from a skin cancer removal, and one has scars from a shoulder surgery.  Haven't seen a noticeable decrease in scar size but the product smells great and is excellent for reducing the itching from the scars.\n",
            "A friend recommended this to me. Was skeptical bc it wasn’t sealed shut when I opened so I returned it and bought else where but it was also not sealed shut there so  I guess that’s just how the company works. Used it throughout my pregnancy on my itchy growing belly and loved it!\n",

            "Used it on both pregnancy along with mama bee. Went thru 2 large bottles a month. Results- no stretch marks. Now I use it over my moisturizer at night, neck, and ant dry spots. Tried to save money by using pure castor, Aragon, and E oil..... can't compare to BIO.\n",

A little disappointing that mineral oil is the first ingredient.  When gone, I will go back to using jojoba, avocado, and other natural oils.  But this one is nice.\n",
            "I tried ordering this product before and it was on backorder for so long the order was canceled so after finally getting it after more than a year I was actually kind of disappointed I guess I just expected it to be more than what it was. I can just as easily use my Neutrogena light sesame oil and get probably even better results\n",
            "My wife is using on her belly and it seems its working. She has pretty sensitive skin and it seems no issues with it. I would like if the scent was not that strong but I'm good with it as it seems to do the Job. We will be continue to buy this Product\n",
            "The smell is very offensive to me. It says rosemary and lavender but all I smell is a perfume powdery scent and but not a good one. Maybe it’s just my nose but I can’t stand the smell and won’t be using it. I was hoping I could find it in a fragrance free but it seems there is just this one scent.\n",
            "This stuff really works at evening skin tone, hydrating dry skin and helping with scars and stretch marks. I use consistently and constantly  to notice a difference. Smells like Christmas my kids say. Absorbs so nicely not oily or greasy.\n",
            "I don't really have any negative reviews for this product. I'm still currently in the testing phase, this being my 2nd bottle. I got stretch marks from my pregnancy, mainly around the back of my knees and thighs. After reading the uses for this product I decided to give it a try.It does not have a horrible scent, actually it's quite pleasing to smell. Leaves my skin feeling moist & oily. I haven't noticed any dryness from using it as I did with other oils. It's quite a small bottle for the price so after rubbing this continuously over my body during my pregnancy I tend to run out of it soon.\n",
            "I bought this after reading reviews and recommendations from postpartum mothers about how this helps with scars and stretch marks. So far I like the scent a lot. I haven’t used it long enough to notice the fading of scars/marks yet.\n",
            "This really works. I had my doubts but I decided to give it a try and it’s works. I got a scar on my face in April and I heard about this product. I bought it and started using it right away. It’s July now and my scar has faded. I don’t need makeup anymore to cover it. It probably would have faded sooner if I used it everyday but I did use it at least 3-5 times a week. And the best part is that I haven’t even used up the bottle. I played softball so I have scars on my legs. I’m definitely going to start using this on those scars.\n",
            "This stuff!!! Wow!! I have very pale skin so even scratching a mosquito bite will give me a scar for a few months, at least. Now I know it seems crazy, but this started reducing look of a few scars on my legs in days, scars that I had had for a few months. It was incredible! Also I cannot seem to find any relief for dry lips, no matter what I try, but this stuff did the trick. It's an all around miracle product! Also, get the small one if you just want to try it because it will last a VERY long time and is a great price!\n",

            "I ordered 3 bottles. Gave 1 bottle a try. No difference provides no help with scars or any moisture.  This is a watered down product and I would like to return the other 2 bottles\n",
            "I’ve been using this product ever since I found out I was pregnant. It’s a little messy getting your hands oily; however, I couldn’t be happier with how it works. I love the smell. It completely cured that itchy feeling you get on your stomach while pregnant. I’ve been applying twice a day for about 6 months now. I’m 30 weeks pregnant and so far have no stretch marks. It makes my skin look amazing and I highly recommend it.\n",

            "This is great for scars and stretch marks! Works so well and it doesn't make you break out because it's non-comedogenic. It seems a bit pricey but it lasts SO long because you only need a tiny amount each application. I would definitely purchase again for myself or anyone who has a scar/stretch marks they want to be rid of fast! I would say give it about a week of consistent twice a day use to see results. Say on it and you will see a difference!\n",
            "I love this product and have been using it for 1-2 months during my first pregnancy. I don’t have any stretch marks thus far.  I use this before bed and wear a shirt over top. It hasn’t stained or ruined any clothes/sheets. The scent is minimal to none. Would reorder!\n",
            "This product is very oily, which makes me nervous when using it on my face. I have acne and am trying to get rid of scars, but am afraid this will break me out. We’ll see.\n"

It seems like my stomach gets a new stretch mark everyday, my breasts have stretch marks, and I just don't enjoy having that on my body. I use this product when I get out of the shower. You have to use this product religiously in order to get the results of less scars and/or stretch marks. They do vanish. The only think I hate about this product when you apply it, your hands always have that nasty, oily feeling from rubbing whatever troubled area you have. Other than that, it's wonderful.\n",

I use immediately after showering when skin is absorbant with open pores. Lather on to abdomen, thighs, back, buttocks, arms above inner part of elbows, and outside of armpit areas (front and back near shoulder crease)  to prevent stretch marks.\n"

I have some slight scarring from bad acne when I was younger and after a few months of applying the Bio Oil the scarring was considerably improved and my skin was smoother. I have oily skin so I was concerned about using any type of oil on my face, but this stuff doesn't make me greasy at all (and I use it before bed). Added bonus; I LOVE the scent.\n",

This stuff smells delicious,very pleasant aroma. I wish I could afford to buy a gallon of this stuff..Love, love,love this oil.Try it, you'll see what I mean. I originally bought it for my son to try for stretch marks on his stomach but after trying it myself on my face just to see what it might help with, I had to buy my own and in a larger bottle. I have been using this product for close to 2 months now and take it with me everywhere.\n",

            "I rated this a 3 because I'm still early in my pregnancy and don't know if this will actually prevent stretch marks in the long run, but so far this was definitely worth the purchase. The oil does have a scent, but I enjoy it and it doesn't bother my nausea like some of the palmers cocoa butter scents did. I also didn't find that this stained any clothing or bed sheets, but I only really used this at night!! Leaves my skin super soft and smooth.\n",

It doesn’t seem to do any better than my natural oils that I already have in my possession..  call the claims of fading scars and dark marks on the skin didn’t really happen for me. It’s all right, but I can do better.\n",

It smells terrible, like those scented bug sprays they had you use when you were a kid but you knew they were still just chemicals. In addition, I do not feel it’s moisturizing. Finally, there is no way I would recommend this for sensitive skin. The fragrance alone is agitating.\n",
            "It moisturizes in a feeble attempt to get rid of stretch marks, it’s never worked for me to remove pre existing ones but I’ve tried it, to prevent them and found if you’re trying to lose weight and that’s why you’re getting stretch marks, it’s not going to work.\n",

The discoloration is no longer there and the actual scar tissue is much softer. I Also on any nicks or marks I get that I don’t want to scar. Recently started using this for wrinkles (it doesn’t clog pores), and lightly all over my face. A little oily at first but it soaks into the skin nicely and you can pat away the excess with a towel.\n",

            "I only gave this 4 stars and not 3 because there is a possibility that what results I did not achieve were a part of my own accord and not the oil itself.I did not try this yet for the 3 months that is required. Atleast religiously, I have not. Therefore, due to the chance that it would have possibly worked, I always leave room or give them the benefit of doubt before slamming a company and their product with 3 stars unless I really did not like the product.Anywho. I bought  this in hopes to get rid of stretch marks on my belly from my pregnancy. I lathered this  oil on for about a week at most with no results. Obviously the oil claims to have an effect if used correctly for the 3 months. Stretch marks take 9 months to grow and appear. A few weeks will not improve outcomes. I am very bad at consistently applying creams for long periods of time. So my advice is, if you are like me and will not apply a product like this one everyday, then you best not buy it.This oil is not a rapid treatment. For that, you can get some mederma or other scar cream. Selevax is good too. Neosporin or plain oils and lotion can do a good job. Not saying this doesnt work, but it is not RAPID. You need to be consistent.The hype with this oil, I just dont understand. It is a good oil, with good ingredients  but that is just that. There isnt any miracle antidote in this bottle. Because purcellin oil, first of all  is just a made up name, similar to how doterra makes up the claim that they are certified pure grade whatever. No such thing.Just letting people know, bio-oil works, but only if used consistently and its ingredients are just plain mineral oil and other ingredients you would find in regular scar removal creams.On another note, it is very greasy and will seep through your clothes if you dont let your body dry before putting garments on.I do have to say though, it smells so good.\n",
            "I love this stuff! Heals my very dry skin and gets rid of stretch marks as well as any other blemishes! Helps skin heal faster too. I love that I could buy such a large amount. Doesnt make my skin extra oily either.\n",
            "I used it for two weeks to find out my face got worse and I started getting cystic acne. DO NOT USE especially with sensitive skin. I saw an article about it and thought it would do good for acne scars but instead, it took me three months after using this for my skin to get better and even then I have scars still present from using it. My best advice, avoid it.\n",
            "Best ever just buy it! Even though it's an oil it absorbs into the skin after few minutes. Doesn't feel heavy. Better than burts bees mama butter. Will repurchase this oil. Currently 34 weeks and have not gotten new stretch marks anywhere. Keeps pre-existencing stretch marks (on outer thigh) at same size. I can be lazy and not apply daily - still keeps skin supple for 1-3 days.\n",
            "Broke me out within a couple hours in a rash/pimple like thing. My skin hated it. I do have pretty sensitive skin though.\n"

I thought after a week I already saw some improvement on the stretch marks on my arms.  (These are my oldest and lightest scars) However within that same week of use my pregnancy stretch marks became incredibly itchy and I developed a rash.  I don't have sensitive skin either.

I had a total knee replacement in September and was using Bio-Oil on my scar to help with healing. I decided to try it all over my itchy legs after I showered after being in the pool. It's a miracle!!! No more itching. And it's working great helping my scar to fade too.\n",

            "At the recommendation of a friend, I started using this every day from the beginning of my 2nd trimester through the end of my pregnancy. I put it on my belly every day and never got a stretch mark. I never thought to put it on my butt - and I got stretch marks. I know they say stretch marks are genetic (either you get them or you don’t) but I think the proof’s in the pudding on this one.\n",

            "Its really good oil, I put it on my tummy every time after I took a shower.I bought two time for my two time pregnancy, my tummy doesn’t have the wrinkles. I like it and it doesn’t have bad smell. Good price as well.\n",
            "This product was recommended by my surgeon to reduce scarring.  I found that it is great for eczema nodosum. If applied as soon as a spot of extra-dry skin is found, Bio-Oil rehydrates the skin before the condition can develop.  A bottle lasts a very long time because only a small amount is required.  Skin slurps it up so there is no oily residue.  The very light scent is also nice.  I now use it wherever my skin gets a little dry\n",
            "After 2 weeks of using this on my face my HUSBAND asked if I was doing anything different because my skin looked so good!\n",
            "I love this bio oil! My skin stays soft and my face glows, my coworkers spotted the difference on my skin tone.It would’ve been nice if the price stays at $12, it keeps changing!It’s worth it tho.\n",

            "If you have sensitive, dry skin, or rosacea, this is the product for you! I’ve been using this product for 2 years now, and I’m obsessed. I use it for uneven skin tone and dry skin. It’s super light, smells good, and never irritates my face. I recently had a massive dry skin rosacea outbreak and used this three times a day and it went away in 2 days!\n",
            "Bought this a couple times throughout my pregnancy and have used it since! It definitely helped my skin. I won't say I don't have any stretch marks, but I do believe this helped reduce them and I still use it on my after-baby tummy.\n",
            "I love this oil! It works so nicely on dry skin. It is not oily like most oils. It settles into skin nicely and leaves you with smooth skin and smelling wonderful. I use this daily on my face and it works wonderfully. My skin glows and does not look even remotely greasy. I have used it for scars and stretch marks but I can't say it is perfect. Although I do think it has been helpful in reducing the appearance of scars, uneven skin tones and stretch marks. AND Amazon does offer the lowest prices for this oil that I have seen. (but shipping charges could change that) I have replaced my daily facial moisturizer with this and it is much cheaper then most of the moisturizers on the market and a little goes a long way!\n",
            "The oil is sort of thin. Not as thick as I expected.  It has an odd smell too.  I am using on a new scar from a surgery & don't see any results yet. I will update in a few weeks to post any new observation.Update::Been using only about 15 days now (2 or 3x a day) but it does seem to have taken the redness out of my scars!! Trying on a few older scars now too.\n",
            "Although the product claims to diminish stretch marks and reduce appearance of scars, I personally haven't seen noticeable benefits. However, this is a great body oil for moisturizing. It is light scented, greasy at first but then the skin absorbs it and the skin is left feeling supple and luscious. I have very dry skin and this oil is lifesaving for me. I sometimes mix it with a little bit of regular body lotion to create an emulsion for lighter hydration or to change the scent. You always need to wait at least 10 minutes before dressing.\n"

Can't comment on the stretch marks but this helps me keep my belly hydrated.I use it with Aquaphor Healing ointment as Bio-oil alone is only good for 1-2 hours but when I use it with Aquaphor I have seen a huge difference and both the product together keep my belly hydrated for longer period of time and I don't feel itchy all the time as I used to before.\n",

I can't tell you if the scaring is finally going due to this or to time but this really feels so good and my scars are now minimal. It acts very oily but it dries (?) and leaves no residue. That is to say while you are massaging it in, it feels very slick but then disappears so you could put on a silk blouse a few minutes after and not have it stick. Not sure how that works. Skin feels and looks lovely.\n",

            "I have been using this product for two weeks twice a day and it changed my face. The second picture is right after I got a scratch on my face and the first is after two weeks of treatment. I wanted something gentle since this was going on my eyes, and it not only healed my scar but also started to correct my dark circles. This isn’t just for stretch marks! And it smells a little like cinnamon!\n",

            "My skin is more towards the oily side. I don't get pimples very often and I'd like to think that my face is pretty clear besides some acne scars. I rubbed this oil on my face after washing my face at night and before going to bed. Within a few days, I had a large pimple on my forehead. I thought, OK it's just one..not a big deal... \"it needs to get worse before it gets better\". A day or two later, I got a huge pimple on my right cheek. Again, I let it slide. Also, as a side note, I was not PMSing or eating greasy/different food...just my regular vegetarian diet. A week or so later, I started getting cystic pimple/nodules on my left cheek. I didn't know WHAT the heck was going on and I tried to stay calm thinking that it's just a phase of using this oil and it'll just go away---I would just conceal the pimples with makeup and try to ignore it. I'm four weeks in and I'm pretty fed up because these cystic pimples on my left cheek look gross and I wish I never used this stuff. I decided to go to a dermatologist today for the first time in my life and he prescribed me doxycycline to clear up the bacteria causing the pimples and also gave me a dark spot corrector. I will update my post in a month to let you all know how that goes. I guess you can't always believe what you read online and all the crazy good reviews because I'm pretty sure my skin got worse after using this stuff because it's the only thing I did differently and my dermatologist said the same. I really suggest that you see an expert before you jump into all these natural cool products that sound amazing and supposedly work for so many people. I really wish this oil would have done all that it proclaims to do but it just didn't :(\n",
            "I’ve been using this for one month now, twice a day, and I can tell a pretty significant difference on how my stretch marks look. It basically takes the redness/purpleness away. I have less than half of a bottle left and will definitely be ordering more.\n",

I now use it on new handbags and boots before I wear them and apply again two or three times a year.  It restores old leather, enhances the shine, and seems to prevent cracking.  Light color leather may darken some but begins to lighten up about twelve hours later.  I do a second coat on wallets and bags where the leather folds to keep it supple.  If it came in gallon size I would use it on my leather furniture.  I spread it around with my fingers and my hands benefit from the treatment, especially cuticles.  I also rub some on my hands before putting on garden gloves.  I don't use it on my face as my skin is oily.  I buy it to use on leather, not on me.\n",

I'll keep using it thou to see if it ends up working and post another review. oh and it makes your face very oily.. I wouldn't recommend. you wanna get rid of ance and scars and stretch marks? I'd buy African black soap\n",

Worth a go if you're at all interested!\n",

I use it twice a day. I was 120 and now am 152, so I have put on considerable weight in my baby bump. I would highly recommend to anyone!!!\n",

After finding out I was allergic to cocoa butter, I knew I needed to find something that would help prevent stretch marks during my pregnancy. Not only does it smell and feel better than then cocoa butter- it works better! I saw a huge difference in my skin and hardly got any stretch marks! I truly believe this product made a difference. I am now using it post partum and it is really helping me to regain elasticity in my belly. Hooked on Bio Oil!\n",

It feels luxurious and like liquid silk. It has a very light, pleasant scent. I imagine that I'll be buying more of this product.\n",

Haven't noticed that it evens my skin tone out but I have only been using it for 2 weeks, putting it on instead of hand cream when I wash my hands. On my face I use it at night to moisturize as I don't mind the greasy feeling. I would buy this again, hope it evens my skin tone out eventually though.\n",

This does have a distinct scent but not overwhelming to a preggo's extreme olfactory nerves. It also feels great on the skin and helped my postpartum stretching and itch. My skin nosedived after pregnancy and was sooo dry. This was a great product. I also use it on my newborn for colic massage. It doesn't stay wet long and therefore is great for quick massages where I need to put her clothes back on. Plus it doesnt stain.\n",

No more dry skin, stretch marks stay to disappear and then the compliments start coming in about how I get my skin so flawless.\n",

I just kept using it until I got the results I wanted. I had to order it again except catch it during the pregnancy lol highly recommended!\n",

It will not make deep scars go away, but it really does soften them. I also use in on my chest for sun spots and overall discoloring and my skin tone is much more even. I use this in place of expensive face creams and it helps with overall skin aging, in my opinion. I use a few drops every night on face/neck/chest and a bottle will last me 9+ months. Great value for the price! It smells good and my skin in super soft.\n",

I really like the product. I use it twice a day. The only drawback is I feel the price is pretty steep for the size bottle you receive but I don't complain too much because the product works for what I need it for.\n"

I was also using it for a scar on my arm, it made my scar hurt so bad! The scar was healed but idk if it's because it's trying to hydrate it that it makes it hurt. But I just stopped using it all together.\n",

It is deep penetrating, light, not oily on the surface, awesomely gentle, very light, natural scent. We've found nothing this good, ever. Seemed too expensive to use as a body and hand lotion, but after the results on face and neck, and given its little amount for large areas, we began using it for everything. We rarely give five stars to anything. This deserves every star.\n",

I will be setting up a S & S for this product as soon a I see how long it lasts.  It is a very light oil that spreads easily on your skin.  A small amount goes a long way.  The \"oiliness\" seems to be absorbed rather quickly (just 2-3 minutes)so that you aren't left feeling greasy. I have noticed a smoothing and softening of my skin & a more even skin tone. I have one age spot on my right hand and that has faded quite a bit, but can still be seen. I only use the oil once a day and am quite satisfied with the results.  (Twice a day is recommended.) If it came with sun screen I would use it twice a day.  Am getting pleasing results with bedtime application. I live in Texas and can't stand a heavy cream or oil on my face in the summer months.  Bio-Oil does not leave my face plastered to my pillowcase at night.  Good on hands and feet, too.  Softens callouses.  Has a pleasant, light fragrance. I would recommend this product to others, especially 50-somethings like myself-- and older.\n",

Apply it on my scar mornings and nights for almost two months (only missed one night).It is a keloide scar so it was deep red at first, after three days of applying bio oil it turned like deep pink..... An improvement and I was happy so continue using it....but no luck for me, i have not seen an improvement and I decided to buy a different product.Bought Mederma, three times applying it to my scar and today I noticed that it has shrink like 20%, even my husband noticed :)I gave it three stars because I also applied bio oil to my face every night and it helped with my skin tone. I will keep applying it every night.I also applied it (mornings and nights) on some old stretch marks and I can see an improvement,  probably I am the only one to see it but I will keep applying it :)I guess it depends on your skin type and you need to try what works best for you..... Good luck!\n",

The appearance of scars was also decreased.  It smells nice, and although it is an oil absorbs well and doesn't leave my clothes and skin too oily during the day or at night.  I usually put it on right after a shower and exfoliating to help it absorb into the skin better, and I wait a few minutes before I put clothes on.  I have also noticed that my skins stays more hydrated and even looking.\n",

This in conjunction with a slightly messy homemade coffee ground scrub got my belly looking worlds better, and that in turn helped my self esteem and alleviated all the frustration I dealt with daily on account of the scars.Nine months in to pregnancy number two and not a single new scar, though one of the old ones is looking a little pink.Just be sure to give this product time to work its magic, I used it for a bit over a year before I decided I was pleased with the results, and then popped it onto our subscribe and save list as soon as we started trying for our 2nd.\n",

            "My friend recommended this to me for evening out my skin tone and removing the appearence of scars on my stomach. I had two surgeries, and so there are prominent scars along my abdomen there. The stomach was operated on the same place twice in 7 years, so to me it looked as if the marks would be permanent.But I started using this for about a week and as far as  my skin tone goes (face) - it is already fairer and almost even now. I also used this on my scars and because they are very prominent keloid scars, so I am sure it will take some time in seeing  any visible changes, or lessening of their appearence, but I am certain that this works...Slight fading of marks can already be witnessed by me. It may take regular application of this oil on the scars for may be a several months, before I completely see them disappear, but I can tell you it works. Slow and steady wins the race, remember?!I also love its pleasant smell! It totally gets absorbed in my skin, when I use it on my face, and my skin has a glowing effect, without being greasy or anything!It has clearly started working for me- someone who has visible surgery marks ( not even just stretch marks ), so I am certain it will definetely help you too!I highly recommend this, but you have to be patient with it, as it may and most certainly will, take time for visible scars to vanish, but trust me, it will pay to stick with it for a while and see the results!P.S - I thought I was never going to be able to flaunt a two-piece after the surgeries, but gradually, I think in the coming months, I will certainly be able to try that out ;)\n",

            "I use oil when I get out of the shower so my skin is already hydrated. This works 100x better than cheap body lotion plus it has a light scent. Will buy again when I run out.\n",
            "Very light and although my skin breakout easily (hormonal issues) this product has not made it any worse. I really love it and use it on a daily basis after washing my face in the morning and before I go to bed. It smells great! I message it on my skin before I apply makeup. It absorbs quickly leaving your skin feeling soft and hydrated.\n",
            "I use this product and my son uses this who has minor burn marks on his arm.  I'm not sure if it is helping, but it certainly doesn't hurt.  It does seem to lighten a scar upon application...but once its 'worn off' scars seem to resume their normal appearance.  Its been just under 3 months for my son and scarring has improved, but that could be just because he's growing and the skin is stretching and smoothing.Either way, can't hurt and it smells nice unlike other scar treatments.\n",

            "I got hit in the lip with a softball this summer and have a nice chunk of scar tissue I have to massage 2x day, which this oil is the perfect consistency for.  To start, the scar was discolored, mainly red, but after about a month of using this stuff it is now the same color as the rest of my face.  I have used it on other scars on myself, and my husband and have found it is a miracle oil!In addition, I have always had issues finding the perfect face lotion, as I am 34, I am not oily, but not dry...right in the middle.  I have tried literally 20-30 lotions over the past few years, from the cheap to the expensive, all seemed to have the same issue with starting off good in the first part of the day, but making my face oily by days end.  Although I finally found a face lotion I love, it is almost $100 for a small container, so one day I thought, why not try the bio-oil?  IT IS OFFICIALLY MY FAVORITE FACE \"LOTION\" EVER!  Not only does my husband daily tell my how much he loves how my face smells, I love how it does not make my face oily at any point in the day.  In addition, I LOVE the way it makes my skin look when I wear no make-up - it really evens out red spots and sun damage.  LOVE this for scars and daily face oil and will never go back to anything else!\n",

            "I purchased Bio-Oil a few months ago, to use during my dry-brushing skin maintenance routine. I have some problem areas, like most women-just some stretch marks, and surgery scars. I have certainly seen a change in all of those areas.. The Bio-Oil is very moisturizing, and seems to really sink in well. It does take a bit to sink in-you have to be careful, and only put a few drops at a time on, then work it it very well, if you put too much you can be greasy for a bit.I aso have the common condition, KP/Keratosis Pillaris...many people know how annoying this yucky chicken skin' can be-and how hard it is to deal with. I have found that, in conjunction with my dry-brushing routine (look on-line for directions how to do this-it really changes your skin for the better), the Bio-Oil has pretty much made the KP go away! Its so much better than using those urea based lotions, that are so gloppy/sticky and stinky!Overall, I have noticed that my skin looks better-softer, smoother, 'glowing'...the stretch marks (which are 9 years old!)  most certainly look better/diminished. The scars (about 8 years old) look softer, not as noticeable, I cant imagine how great they would look if I had begun to use the oil from the very start of my pregnant-I dare say that some of them could have been prevented, outright! I'm on my second bottle of Bio-Oil, my first lasted a few months, and I used it at least 3x/week. You don't need very much. I will most certainly continue using Bio-Oil, hopefully it will continue to make my skin look better. Oh-lastly-I have a little wire-haired dog that gets really dry skin as the weather cools and the heater comes on. He's been scratching his back like mad-so a put a few drops of Bio-Oil (just a few!) and rubbed in into his skin/fur, really well. Hasn't scratched since, which is fantastic, because he was driving himself and us crazy at night! I am NOT a vet, nor am I saying you should use this on your dog without asking your vet, and making sure that the itching isnt being cause by fleas or another issue. I just took a chance with this, because the ingredients didn't indicate anything that would be a danger to my little man, so, if your vet 'ok's' it for use and you have an itchy fur-baby, its certainly worth a chance!  I will (and have) bought and continue to use Bio-Oil regularly, it's a great product.\n",
            "I haven’t noticed any change in appearance of three different scars I have (two on knees and one on arm)\n",
            "It works I’ve tried so many stretch mark products and this is the only one that has worked for me.\n",
            "It works fast on stretch marks that aren't deep. it will take some time on deeper stretch marks. It does work but slow.\n",
            "This stuff is great. It smells really good and has done a great job of reducing appearance of scars.  I had gotten a rash on my stomach that left scars and would not go away until I started using this stuff. A girlfriend also mentioned she puts it on her face and took away scars from adolescent acne. It also didn't seem to stain my clothing since I was putting it on my stomach. Great product.\n",
            "Started using this product the beginning of my 2nd trimester. I love it so much! No sign of any stretch marks and it makes my tummy feel soft and smooth through this stretching process.\n",
            "I saw an immediate difference the next day. I have stretch marks from the top of my belly button down to my thighs from hip to hip. Also, TUMMY TUCK AND BREAST AG SCAR. It has flatten, gotten smoother and lighter. I love this product and highly recommend it. I am Spanish with medium light skin tone.\n",

It has a faint baby powder scent. Would be so nice if it were unscented. Otherwise excellent product.\n"

            "I've been using Bio oil somewhat inconsistently as I have scars (I'm Afro-Caribbean) from childhood eczema, volleyball floor burn scars, scars from self-harm...my skin's a scarry mess.Over time, it has reduced the appearance of my dark scars.I recently had surgery, and immediately, my surgical scar started to hyperpigment. I started using Bio oil on it once the incision closed and pretty much the day after (no exaggeration, I'm not a paid reviewer) the scar started to improve in appearance. The newer the scar, the better and faster the results will be as with anything else for scar removal and skin care.While I'm no longer using Bio oil on my scar (I got some pure lanolin oil from a colleague and that's working a bit better on my incisional scar) I plan to continue using it on my legs and now my face as I find the lanolin oil to be too thick to want to put it on my entire body (I tried it Bio oil on my face once and I didn't break out but it's pretty greasy, I'll only use it at night).And I think if you use it more consistently it will help. It also worked better on my oldest scars that had already begun to fade because of aging, so it seems like it struggles the most with very dark scars that are somewhere in the middle of the timeline. The eczema scars on my thighs are responding better than the newer and darker scar from eczema on my calf. I'm trying to get my legs to the point where I no longer have to cover them with Sally Hansen's perfect legs or whatever it's called, and hoping consistent use of this will get me there.Plan to try it to see if it'll have the same effect on my face and some new dark stretch marks on my hips that appeared with recent weight gain. I will probably update my review but I don't think I can bring myself to take photos, I find my scars so disconcerting...but maybe I will...for science! LolNot giving 5 stars cause it's not as natural as I'd hoped, but as with anything, the dose makes the poison. It's working, I'm not dying or getting sick so I'm not going to let a few chemicals scare me away. Everything is technically a chemical.\n",

It's gentle enough for my sensitive and acne prone facial skin and does not appear to cause any breakouts after applied. It smells wonderful and the texture is nice.

I used this as well as another scar cream so it was not a stand alone use, but the scar does look much better now between the two products.I do use this as a moisturizer on my face as it gets very dry and peels.

I'm still using the bio oil in hopes of allot more results in combination with my daily routine of skin creams, bronzer and what not, I recommend it to anyone who reads this, it's worth a shot to try it, seriously, added bonus, I put it on my face while applying it and my skin tone all around has evened out allot, my whole body has a glow almost, very nice, I only rated four stars because it consumes allot of time applying it to your entire body and letting it dry, it is pretty oily, but well worth the sacrifice I think\n",

I know I'm about to enter a period where I'm going to be growing more rapidly than ever, so that will be the true test of this product for me, but so far so good. I am prone to stretch marks (have them on the sides of my thighs and the back of my calves) so I am just waiting for the day that I get some pregnancy marks. I am pleased that I haven't gotten any so far, and if I last throughout my entire pregnancy without them then I will thank Bio Oil and my lucky stars!

Purchased after the fact, to prevent them from getting worse/help to lighten them. In hindsight would've been interesting to see if it actually worked as a preventative... Helps reduce itching, and moisturizes. Using on belly and now on breasts in case when my milk comes in, and they increase in size- worried my faint old stretch marks may worsen, or may get new ones. Also using on arms similarly, to prevent worsening of old existing old marks, since I've gained weight during pregnancy. I like the smell too, seems beachy and happy in a sense. Used to using lotion so not sure how much oil is suitable to apply to each area in order to be \"effective\". Just kinda gauge it by how moisturized it feels I guess... So much cheaper on Amazon than in stores!!\n",

You must have patience. It took two bottles before my stretch marks faded. It is a bit greasy and has an odd smell, but I don't mind it because of how wondefully it works. This product shipped quickly and was in great shape when it arrived.\n",

The oil created better elasticity as my tummy grew and as a bonus, faded scars from the multiple laparoscopic surgeries that I've had. I recently purchased a 2nd bottle because I just can't live without this product. In addition to using it morning and night I'll apply more when my tummy feels dry and stretched. Now in my 3rd trimester and only recently am I seeing signs of tiny stretch marks (they are hereditary after all, but as I can personally attest, can be staved off for a time). I highly recommend this product for prego ladies and individuals who want to lighten stretch marks or surgery scars.***The oil dries quickly, but you want to be sure it does before putting your clothes on as it can leave a bit of a stain.\n"

I have tried \"several\" expensive and inexpensive different creams and products and nothing has resolved the problem of dry, itchy skin in the eye area. Then I tried BIO-OIL and the after the first night I noticed remarkedly improved skin.  I apply the oil to my clean face at night and apply it to my eye area and face.  It feels greasy when first applied, but absorbs through the night as I sleep.

            "As an expecting parent you read all sorts of articles to determine what are the best products whilst trying to ensure you get good value for money. As instructed I have just started my second trimester and begun to use the bio oil twice daily. Hopefully it will help to prevent any stretch marks as my mother has some pretty deep and dark ones on her stomach and thighs. I sometimes add some palmers stretch mark cream during the day just to ensure that my skin in those stretch mark prone areas are well moisturized. I heard that's the most that can be done, keeping the skin lubricated! I'm certainly going to try my best to keep the regime for the entire pregnancy and keep the faith that no stretch marks appear! Can't hurt as I see it!  Will post after pregnancy with the hopefully stretch mark free results! Oh, the smell of the bio oil I like and it only takes about 5 minutes to absorb so the residue left in your skin is not bad!\n",

I am working on fresh surgery scars. The recovery has been slower than I'd hoped, and I've been using silicone tape alone. When I added this to the mix, I could see a difference in just one day. I am three days in now and the healing has rapidly increased. Why doesn't everyone know about this?!The bottle is also bigger than expected and will last for a long time.\n",
            "I have been using Bio-Oil for about a month now, with the hopes of reducing some unsightly stretchmarks on my thighs.  The oil feels nice on my skin, but I really looks like my stretchmarks have gotten worse.  Maybe I just need to use it longer, or perhaps it works best as a preventative measure.  I will keep using it until the bottle is gone though, and perhaps I will find a reason to change my rating.\n",
            "What can I say, it's inexpensive, so you get what you pay for. It has lots of mineral oil which is pretty much just a filler or an ingredient that coats the skin but it does prevent moisture loss. I've been applying it religiously to my thighs during pregnancy. I don't think that it's reduced the appearance of my stretch marks, but I do believe it's prevented me from getting more.\n",
            "I use BIO-OIL for my stretch marks and scars from unfortunate surgery. Over time the color got lighter and softer to the touch. I was on my way to the pharmacy since the bottle was almost empty. I, of course, checked with AMAZON and there it was in a bigger bottle which is a GREAT deal! When I run out I will reorder.\n",

            "I started using this early in my second trimester to avoid stretch marks.  I am now 33 weeks along and have gained 28lbs (all belly, it's huge!) and so far haven't gotten any.  I am prone to stretch marks and have several old ones from being overweight for most of my life.  I had lost 70lbs. before getting pregnant and knowing that I had developed stretch marks in the past I was worried about creating new ones. I did get a couple of rather large pimples on my belly (I am also acne prone and my skin has been horrible ever since getting pregnant, so maybe it wasn't cause by the oil) but in any case I'd much rather have a couple breakouts than permanent scarring from stretch marks.  I read a lot about stretch marks being mostly due to genetics so I thought it was inevitable that I'd get a bunch, but figured I'd give it a try anyway.  I use this every night after my shower and sometimes in the morning.  I also eat healthy and exercise which is said to help circulation and avoid rapid weight gain which also causes stretch marks.  I think the combination of the oil, exercise, and diet are all keeping me stretch mark free.  I have 7 weeks to go, so far so good, I'm keeping my fingers crossed.\n",
            "It’s great for skin and hair!\n",
            "I love this oil. It's not greasy at all and after using if for 2 weeks I noticed my acne scars going away. Not only does it help with acne scars but acne in general. I could tell some pimples were forming on my face but after using the bio oil they went away in a couple days. Cheap and affordable! I love it!!\n",
            "i got red spot all over my belly. It seems like allergy\n",
            "Love this product! Would definitely reorder. Gets rid of acne scars, while evening out ur skin tone. Apart from ur daily skin care routine, It can also work as a primer or moisturizer.\n",
            "Love this stuff would recommend to everyone. I actually have recommended it to many people already. I’ve only been using it one month so will do an update again in a fewMonths.\n",
            "I have stretch marks from two pregnancies as well as recent sterilization scars. I put the oil on twice a day and I've seen such a huge difference in only a month and a half! So many of my stretch marks have faded completely and my scars are clearing up quickly. Absolutely love this oil!\n",
            "DO NOT BUY!!! I can’t express it enough on how badly this messed my skin up even more; gave me black chucks of spots on my chest and worsened my acne. ITS A FAKE.\n",
            "I cannot say enough about Bio Oil. The best thing I have found for an itchy belly. I still got stretch marks though.  But it seemed to help minimize the and make you skin more elastic. I didn't not start using this until about 5 month pregnant too. I am sure if I started from the beginning it would have made a difference. It is expensive but 100% worth it.\n"

            "I've purchased Bio Oil multiple times and finally went for the 6.7 ounce bottle. I use it on my stretch marks from gaining weight. The stretch marks were \"fresh\" and it took my stomach to an angry red line mess to barely noticeable. Bio Oil does have a distinct smell, citrus-like, maybe an orange. It's okay, not a bad smell, but definitely noticeable. Bio Oil is a bit messy. It tends to leave oil marks on any surface the bottle comes in contact with. Which is fine, just wipe it up or do it in your bathroom. Quantity wise, I have never found myself going through Bio Oil at an alarming rate. The price is a bit high, but I'm expecting the 6.7 ounce to last me 2+ months, so worth it in my opinion. At the end of the bottle you can really stretch the use too.Now, keep in mind. Stretch marks will never 100% go away, they are essentially scars. Bio Oil helped mostly with the coloration. You will still be able to see stretch marks even with Bio Oil. Personally, the stretch marks went from a red-purple to a shiny white (a whiter white then I am and I'm pale as can be). Bio Oil also thinned the stretch marks a bit. I call this successful. They will never fully disappear and do not believe anyone that tells you different (with the exception of drastic measures).ps: I think the fact I was treating new scars might have helped make Bio Oil so successful.The only product I would recommend for stretch marks, I hope it works for you like it did for me!\n",
            "Has a great light and scent. Helped clear redness on face and dry skin/eczema on arms and legs.\n",
            "Used this every day on my belly while I was pregnant... and don’t have any stretch marks! I went through 1 and a half 4.2 oz bottles throughout the 9 months, so the bigger size would probably last a full 9 months.\n",
            "Works pretty good. I used this on stretch marks and scars and it did the job. It took a while until I saw some results but the imperfections did fade away.\n",
            "First off, if I could give this more stars, I would. I had surgery on my wrist, and when the stitches were removed, the doctor replaced them with some very, very adhesive tape. The doctor, however, wasn't careful in placement and two of the pieces overlapped and it caused the skin to tear terribly whenever I moved my wrist. Along with bleeding, and an excessive amount of pain, it caused the scar to deform over half of the length of the incision and, well, I was pretty desperate to find something to lessen the color and swelling.While I admit that a good portion of the state of my wrist now (Which is faded, and the scar tissue has broken down considerably) has been the act of consistently rubbing the tissue, I always see a color change from slightly pink (Or purple on bad days) to a much paler version whenever I use this, and over time my scar is much lighter, much faster, than any other scar that I've previously had that I haven't used this on. I've tried it with lotion over several days, just to see what happened, and it doesn't have the dramatic lightening effect that this Bio-oil does.\n",

I'm 8 months pregnant and even though I've been drenching myself with coconut oil and Burt's Bees pregnancy oil, my belly and breasts are still itchy and my skin felt tight. The moment I put this oil on, the itch went away and the tightness disappeared. A little TMI but I'm on day 2 of using it and applying 2x a day and I noticed my areolas are soft and supple whereas before they were dry and peeling despite the other stuff I was using. I even put this on my 2 year old's eczema on her arms and I haven't seen her scratch not once. I just wish I had this stuff when I was pregnant with my other 3 kids.\n",

Yes, I do still have visible scars after 3 months of use but I am still very impressed. So impressed, in fact, that I decided to try putting it on my face. I am 19 years old and have been struggling with pretty bad acne for about 4 years. Nothing I tried worked except for oral medications that my doctor prescribed but she was not able to continue prescribing it because I would begin to build a tolerance. I switched back to creams and the ance came back along with intense dry skin. I thought the oil would help with the dry skin and the old scars but I was absolutely amazed by what else it could do. After one use there was a noticeable change in my skin and now after about 3 weeks of using it on my acne, it is almost 100% clear. I highly recommend this for anyone who feels like there is no hope for their skin. I didn't think it'd work and now I swear by it.\n",

I usually apply it generously at night have have noticed a slight improvement so far. The directions say to apply 2-3 times a day so I am going to try and remember to apply it in the mornings as well. I will update after a while on any further improvement.\n",

I have never had a problem with bio oil and it has always worked wonders for me, but I will update this review on the results of its usefulness on the stomach when I hear back.\n",

I used it for about 2 months and saw no difference. As expected, the product is very oily and actually stained some of my clothes. After 2 moths of use I stopped using the product.\n",

I guess people might fear that they are heavy or oily on your skin,  but the good ones are not.  Instead they glide on easily (sometimes you have to warm them in your palm for a minute) should sink into your skin easily too.I like this oil,  it goes in easily and has a faint pleasant smell (some Declore oils are too strongly scented for me)  This comes in a plastic bottle which is actually a benefit,  because your fingers get slippery and I've shattered an expensive oil moisturizer before.  It claims to be very effective on scars.  I don't have much scarring but I do have uneven skin tone.  I haven't noticed a huge difference since using it,  but I have very sensitive eyes and they haven't reacted to this oil,  so that's a big plus for me.Edited to add that when I finished this bottle I did order another one,  so it's definitely worth having in the house for me.  I find it excellent during the harsh NY winters,  but also in the spring when I get hayfever and sore eyes,  and this oil is soft and pure enough to use on my eyes even then,  and stop them from being even more miserable.  So a happy find.\n",

They protrude just as much, no difference in that. One thing that Bio-Oil helps with is the skin dryness and irritation Mederma causes. I use Mederma at night and in the morning my skin is dry and irritated. I put on the Bio-Oil and the dryness and irritation immediately go away. So they compliment each other well, now if only they did their job.So if Bio-Oil doesn't work, why do I still use it and give it 3 stars? Because I know that scar products can take a LONG time to work. It's only been 4 months. If by this time next year I still have no results then I will knock those 3 stars down to a big fat zero :)\n",

It may have faded about 5% over 3 months, so not a miracle cure. However, Bio Oil works great as a moisturizer. I have used it on my skin after getting mild sunburn and it was very soothing and helped my skin feel less raw than a regular lotion. I am currently pregnant and using Bio Oil on my torso, 3 times a day (morning, after shower, and before bed). No stretch marks so far but I'm only 22 weeks along. My mother did get bad stretch marks so it may be in my future. I will update this review in November '16 after baby is born!Update: No stretch marks after pregnancy. I wouldn't attribute all my success to Bio Oil. Maybe it was luck, or the fact my daughter was born a week and a half early.

Even though after talking to my dermatologist I had learned that stretch marks are a genetic thing and if your mom had them it is very, very likely that you'll get them too.  The only thing you can really do is try to control the weight gain to hopefully get a small amount.  Anyway, I used it every day, twice a day.  At the eight month one stretch mark popped and then many, many more followed.  I am still giving his product 3 stars because it does function well as a moisturizer for distress pregnant woman belly skin.  It helped immensely when I was itchy due to skin stretching.\n",

I was a little skeptical, but willing to give it a shot.  I started using it in my second trimester, before I really started showing, twice a day, morning and night on my belly and sides.  I'm now past my 37th week and don't have a single stretch mark!Two down sides.  First, I did have some minor breakouts, not used to having those on my sides!  Second, I wore a dark gray jersey dress, I noticed a little bit of a belly print, kind of like a water mark.  It wasn't noticeable when I was out, but when I took it off, I could tell.  It washed right out without a problem.  Something some spanx probably would have prevented.I also used the Amazon subscription service and got a 2 oz bottle once a month.  I did have to buy an extra bottle a couple of times, but I was pretty liberal with my application.  The subscription was very handy!Overall, I'll take a few temporary breakouts to stave off stretch marks.  Well worth it!\n",

After looking up EWG's grade on the harmfulness of the chemicals and the product I decided to return it. Out of a scale from 1 to 10 with 10 being the most harmful this product is an eight. It states that many of the ingredients are endocrine Disruptors among other things and I would think twice especially when using this while pregnant. I try to avoid any chemicals especially while pregnant that could affect the baby's development and I am really saddened that this company is pushing this product for pregnant women when I'm sure they're aware that the ingredients are not healthy\n",

So far I've been using it for 3 weeks and am already seeing results. My stretch marks first turn red then lighten. I'm currently at the red stage. As for scars, I'm not sure it works as well for mine as it does my stretch marks. I'm now using on my face to clear up dark spots. Hopefully it works its wonders on those.\n",

I actually went to a chain drug store to purchase, actually had the 4oz. bottle in my hand and as I was walking toward the cash register thought, \"hey I should check out the prize on Amazon\" and was thrilled to see it for less than half the price!  I rarely (never) order from Amazon on my phone but in that instance, I used one-click ordering and it was on the way before I walked out of the drug store with my beef jerky and lip balm.As far as the product itself - it smells amazing, feels silky when applying, and absorbs quickly.  I have used it liberally on my foot twice daily for about 2 months, and the 4oz. bottle is less than 10% gone - so it goes a LONG way!  The scar is healing nicely too.\n",

I followed the directions on the package closely and religiously, but did not see much improvement over a 6-week application period. That may be because these are old scars, so if like me you wanted to try out this product to see if it will fix old scars, I would steer you away from this product. There are not many solutions for scar healing that aren't surgical, but this product would likely have worked better if I had used it closer to the original wounding.I do not give 5-star reviews unless an interaction with a seller was perfect and I felt that they went above and beyond the call of duty for their product by answering questions or otherwise accommodating my purchase.\n",

Some scars were bigger (closer to a quarter size) - looked really ugly and embarrassing.  I was running out of the med the dermatologist had prescribed, and the next appointment was a week away, so i started using this.  Wow!  Within 3 nights, the new dark spots are almost half gone, and the bumps are now almost smooth to skin.  The existing purplish scars have faded significantly, and no itching.  I am shocked!  I may not even need my dermatologist appointment or a refill at this rate!  I am using this at night now, for both my arms and legs.  I have not used it on my face yet (i worry about breakouts) , but i might try that at a later point - so far, i am shocked at how incredibly effective this is.  Far exceeded my expectations.\n",

It helps moisturize my dry skin better, reduce acne scars, and improve general complexion/tone of my skin. It also helps reduce the appearance my forehead wrinkles (I'm 23) somewhat.

However, now I usually take showers at night and then apply it, then wake up and apply it again.  I can't do it through the day because I work and I don't want my clothes to get that oil stain.UPDATE:  I'm 12 days before I deliver and I still don't have stretchmarks.  I apply it at least 2 times a day, but I have been switching between Bio-Oil and Coconut oil.  I drink plenty of water and I think its all of the above things that have made me keep away from the stretchmarks.  I have gained 40 lbs now.\n",
            "Let me first start off by saying, I started using (almost night) from about 10 weeks pregnant. I initially started using to help immediately fade stretch marks. Stretch marks start from the inside and there is NOTHING topical that will reach the depths of the damaged skin (you must attack that from the inside... ie. increase collogan in diet, etc). I did however think “well, if I can’t control the stretch marks, I can at least help my skin become hydrated enough to where it will stretch easier (hopefully reducing the onset of stretch marks) and then, once they do appear, I will be treating the coloring of them before I even notice them. I started applying religiously, after my nightly shower, once I started showing around 14ish weeks. I am now 36 weeks and still have zero stretch marks. Will I get them? I have no clue. But what I will tell you, is I have had ZERO skin issues since I began showing. No dryness, no itching, no cracking. My skin looks beautiful and healthy and feels that way. Needless to say, I’m so glad I stumbled upon this to use, not just for treating marks - but for the health of my skin. I plan to use it after I give birth in lieu of lotion, indefinitely.\n",
            "it personally didn't do anything for my skin.\n",

I use it from head to toe whenever I want an improvement to my skin or when I lose or gain weight and don't want stretch marks (fantastic for that) or for dry skin, etc.  Yes, it does go on greasy, especially since I have a tendency to use too much, but within 10 minutes or so, it's not so oily and eventually, it's not too oily at all.  I always have at least two bottles in our home, one to use and one for a back-up.  Amazon's price beats the prices our local stores sell it for, so re-ordering is simple and the delivery is quick.  Note: 10-6-16  Just ordered the 2 oz bottle.  So convenient. I keep it in the living room for late-night usage.  Besides being great moisturizer for my skin and reducing dark spots & wrinkles, it's great for cuticles.  As for the price online, I just went to Walmart and it was almost $5 more for the four oz bottle.  Glad to know that amazon.com offers it at a lower cost.Love it!\n",

Once the surgical site was scabbed over, I began using the Bio Oil and literally overnight the healing process accelerated. I have since began using it on older scars with very positive results. I just bought a larger bottle so that I can use it even more liberally on other parts of my body. I love the texture and smell, and the natural ingredients. It can be a little oily at first, until you rub it in. Highly recommended, not only for scars but for surgical site healing.\n",

It won't stain your clothes or be like Vaseline and be greasy.  Even has used it for bad diaper rash (very inflamed).  A friend used it on keloids from earrings that we accidentally ripped out.  Reduced the size of those by 80%, now they are not even noticeable.  If it's not working, you are probably not applying often enough.  Can't expect results using it once or twice a week.\n",

I also wanted to protect against getting stretch marks. I am currently 26 weeks pregnant. I have been using the oil once per day after I get out of the shower. The fragrance is light but takes some getting used to. I am super sensitive to smells but this oil has not been a problem. I love the feel of the oil; it glides on smooth and soaks in nicely and is not sticky at all. It easily washes off my hands when done applying. The itching has nearly completely resolved and I have not one stretch mark! I do believe however that stretch marks are hereditary and my mom never got them either. But I also believe that by taking care of your skin you can reduce the severity and number of marks that appear. I have not tried any other products out there as this is the first I bought and so far it's working great!\n",

I purchased it to help diminish the appearance of stretch marks,  I don't see a big change there yet but it does say you need to use it for at least 3 months to see a difference. A little goes a long way, doesn't leave you greasy.\n",
            "It did produced noticeable results so therefore I gave it 5 stars for working as intended. However it will depend on your own skin situation (stretch mark age, how well you hydrate, how often you exfoliate) on how you will see your own unique results.\n",

I'm using it on my face because I've been battling with dry skin and spots on my face due to my dry skin. I've tried the most emollient products I can find an nothing was helping, at all!!! Finally decided to buy bio-oil and I can't believe I've been suffering for so long! Can't wait to see the end result!\n",

I've only been using bio oil and \"strexderma\" for about a two weeks, so no real results yet. Time will tell and if I remember I will come back to update this review.However, I will say that I LOVE the way that it makes my skin feel and the smell is not bad. I use Bio- Oil in conjunction with Strexderma and Palmers Cocoa Butter or Shea Butter(depending on how I feel at that moment.)My biggest problem with my stretch marks is me. I probably could have \"minimized the appearance\" of them years ago had I been in tune with my body. I have a serious skincare regimen for my face and neck-- no blemishes, marks, or anything. Common sense should have told me to do the same with other parts of my body. Now, every morning and night I rub my tummy, butt cheeks, back of thighs and in between, legs, etc. with oil and cream. Those are the areas that we (well I can only speak for me) often forget to moisturize and most often the driest part of our body. As you read my review, rub the front and back of your thigh and compare. Notice a difference? Hmmm... Anyway, I hope this helps someone.I know their isn't a magic cream on the market that will completely remove my stretch marks, but it doesn't hurt to try. Dieting and proper hydration is also essential.\n",

The ingredients are all pretty good for skin conditions and scarring so I am pretty hopeful that it will work as directed in 3 months.  Like some other reviewers have stated this product does make the skin feel greasy and oil, but that is because it is an oil based product.  I wouldn't suggest this product for anyone who needs to use it in a very noticeable area all day, but you could try putting it on and then after it sits for a while take any excess oil off with a paper towel to see how it works.  I will follow up in a few months to give a better review based on the results I see.\n",

This is the first product that has diminished those radiation effects. My skin has stopped shredding when I shower.  The hyper- & hypo-pigmentation is diminishing. My skin feels like human skin instead of alligator skin for the first time in a year.  I have not seen any noteworthy improvement in my multiple surgical scars.  I have only been using this product for a month.  I apply it on my entire body but not my face.  If  it diminishes my scars or has additional observable benefits after a few months of use I will update this review at that time. Nothing else I tried had any noticeable effect on my skin.

I didn't have any stretch marks prior to 20 weeks, and I began using this product in the mornings after my shower on my tummy, chest, and hips (I continued to use the belly butter in the evenings).  I love how long this product lasts and how well it absorbs, so I started using it in the mornings and evenings around 25 weeks.  I'm 30 weeks right now, still have 1/4 of the bottle left, and no stretch marks yet.  I understand that stretch marks are genetic and you'll get them if you're meant to get them... but I truly think Bio Oil will at least help reduce their visibility and severity.  I got stretch marks from weight gain in middle and high school, so I've always expected to get them during pregnancy.  But nothing yet, although I have another 30 weeks to go.  Fingers crossed!! Oh, and this product smells good, too, which is important for our sensitive noises and gag reflexes. ;)\n",

I have used others products that don't leave the oily film, but they don't last as long and have to be applied more frequently.  The fragrance isn't great, but it also isn't horrible.

            "I started using this yesterday so I can’t confirm the results of the product yet, but three things I like: 1) the smell is very pleasant and I find fades away once the oil is really absorbed. It reminds me of a more subtle version of Avon skin so soft. 2) the packaging is good - there is a cap that only allows a small amount of flow so you aren’t losing most of the product by pouring out too much. 3) the oil is very smooth and leaves skin really soft. I rub it on my 7 month pregnant belly and then rub whatever is left on hands into my hands and they don’t feel greasy. They feel soft and moisturized.As far as preventing stretch marks, I can’t speak to the effects yet. I’ve been using vitamin E lotion the whole time, but this oil came highly recommended. I prefer the oil to the lotion - it just seems more effective, but that could be the sheen of oil playing tricks on me.\n",

When I tell people I'm 44, they are a little surprised... in a good way. Using Bio-Oil has helped me keep my face soft and smooth and I consider it my secret in staying youthful. Additional uses?

You can even take it to use for the Non-stress test monitoring instead of the ultrasound gel. For the final month (when you start to feel your skin getting tight) I slathered this on, waited a few minutes and topped with a heavier pregnancy sunflower-based oil. Much thicker and greasier.  This is the best for every-day. I now subscribe to this and use it as a body moisturizer and cuticle cream.  I wont ever go back to lotion or cream.\n",

Sure it is an oil, but I have to wash my hands multiple times after applying it to get rid of the greasy feeling. I use a cotton ball to apply it and still manage to get greasy fingers. Even just putting it on my scar, I only use it at night because I don't want it to get on my work clothes. I've never spilled it, but the bottle is also now a greasy mess, leaving a greasy ring on the shelf in my bathroom. My scar looks pretty nice after several months of use, but I started using this product right after the dermabond glue peeled off, so I really can't say what it would look like if I hadn't applied this product.\n",

I've been using this product for over a year and I would say that there is no noticeable difference in my stretch marks. I was disappointed at first but then I fell in love with this product, but not because of it reducing the appearance of my stretchmarks but because it is a great facial moisturizer! I would say my face goes through difference phases of being very oily and very dry. I've struggled to find the right moisturizer for that reason. This product however starts off oily and then drys on looking matt! It leaves my face feeling silky smooth without feeling oily (a little goes a long way). If I accidentally use too much, I just blot the excess with toilet paper. Some reviewers complain about the smell but I love it. It think it has a subtle floral smell which dissipates throughout the day.  I use this product in the morning and at night after I wash my face. Four starts because of it being a great facial moisturizer but minus one star for not helping my stretch marks. I'm still buying this product and will continue to buy.\n",

Lotions without oil just do not do it for me and my skin stays dry and can occasionally start to flake a lot.  Bio oil has helped with my dry skin so much, without causing any extra break outs. It's been a real life saver, and has even helped with my skin tone as an added bonus.Not everyone has the same type of skin, and everyone reacts differently to different products. But if you're struggling like me, it's worth a shot since it is fairly affordable. Worst case scenario is it doesn't work for your face because of break outs, you can still use it on other problem areas such as elbows.\n",

I use it more so because it moisturizes well, smells lovely, and to pacify myself psychologically into believing it's preventing stretch marks. I do have stretch marks on my thighs and it has done nothing for those. To be honest, the super positive reviews I've seen for diminishing stretch marks all come from fair skinned individuals. If you're darker skinned, you may be disappointed.FYI, I'm going to take before and after pictures with this new bottle for the new stretch marks on my belly (it's only two of them right below belly button).

I used this twice a day with my first child and am using it again with my second.  I have about three very faint stretch marks from my 8.5lb first child.  While it's super greasy to apply (it is oil after all), it dries quickly and leaves no residue on my clothes.  There is no fragrance too which is nice when your pregnant.  If I feel super full after a meal and feel my skin stretching, I will apply a little oil and my skin is fine.The price in the stores is much higher than on Amazon and if you subscribe and save, you can reduce the price even more.\n",

The same thing happened when I used the Palmer's lotion, so for people with eczema it is a process of figuring out what works and doesn't. But I can still use it on my face to even out skin tone and for dryness as well as on my legs for stretch marks that I may have there. I love the subtle scent it is almost powdery and I find a little goes a long way.

It's hard to get in the habit of applying but I keep it by my lotion so I always apply it after a shower (and again before bed). A little goes a long way in this bottle. Every time I look at it, I'm surprised as to how much I still have.On my surgery scars, those are already self healing so I can't 100% claim that this helps, but I fully believe it does! I also use this on my old stretch marks on my butt that has been there for years and I have seen them fade over weeks time. Of course they're not fully gone but they are not as noticeable as before.

I've never struggled with acne or oil skin and then I turned 28 and boom - horrible  I used all kinds of expensive skin care regiments. And it was just getting worse and left scars. That why I tried Bio-oil. I stopped using all my other products including the acne treatments. I use a Clairasonic with a Sensative skin wash before bed, then Bio-oil. In the morning I just wash my face with my hands and water and Bio-oil. Oily skin stopped within days and the acne scaring faded in only a couple weeks. It's seriously a miracle product. I still get breakouts but not nearly enough probably because my skin is super hydrated now. Try it!!! Bonus.... I use it as eye makeup remover. Amazing.\n",

I have some dark scars on my legs from when I have cut myself with a razor while shaving. It took about 2 to 3 months of persistence, applying twice a day at night and in the morning but they are almost completely gone! I also had 2 spots that were from breaking out and because they were newer scars they completely disappeared in less than a month using this! The longer you've had the scars the longer it will take to make less noticeable (especially the dark ones like I had on my legs). I would suggest anyone one who has scars anywhere to try this!\n",

I do like that it absorbs very well and doesn't leave much of an oily feel. The smell was a bit strong for me though, I have a strong sensitivity to smells, but some may find it appealing, I thought I smelled a bit like an old lady. I also wouldn't be comfortable applying to the face. I feel it may cause breakouts, but I have sensitive skin so it may work wonders for people with darker skin tones.I haven't seen much difference with the stretch marks yet, but it does make the skin soft. Conclusion, I would save my money and buy something at an Apothecary or natural pharmacy next time.\n",

            "I'm VERY mixed about this product. I bought it for help with 10+ year old stretch marks form puberty. I only used it for a month so I can't talk about longer term effects. In the month of use I did like how it made my skin feel. But I'm very mixed due to things I've read about the product.I like how bio-oil smells, I like how it feels on my skin, I like the great reviews. But I DON'T like the ingredients or the negative assessments of the product. This oil contains things that other products strive to keep OUT of their products (Parabens). And it contains almost no pure natural oils. The ingredient list is honestly a little scary. Especially since they tell you to use it while pregnant. If you look up bio-oil on youtube you find scary videos of people talking about how it is basically mineral oil and how that's bad...comes from crude oil etc, but baby oil is also basically mineral oil. So, honestly it's all very confusing.Due to all the research I did, I've chosen to switch to natural and 100% pure oils. I've looked up some recipes for skin/stretch mark care blends online (some recipes can be found here: [...]. I just feel better buying 100% natural and pure oils (NOW is a good brand) like, Grapeseed, Argan, JoJoba etc. and mixing my own blend for my skin. People have been using natural oils for thousands of years so I feel safer with those.I say, believe what you want about bio-oil...make your own judgements. I'm certainly not throwing away my bio-oil but I think I might just keep it as something I occasionally use for shoulder massages and things. I've decided not to use it on a daily basis though.Also, if your looking for really good natural products the 100% Pure brand is nice ([...]). They have lotions, soaps, cosmetics, Argan oil...but are a little pricey.Another great brand of organic soaps and products is Dr. Bronners. It's been around forever and it's great. I especially love the Peppermint products.\n",

            "One of my friend from Italy suggested this product for dry skin ant stretch marks. I started using it 2 months ago I am very happy with it. At the beginning of the third trimester the skin of my face started to dry very quickly and my moisturizing cream wasn't working at all. I started using this bio-oil and in less then three days the dryness was almost gone and after one week my skin was normal again. You don't have to use too much product, it dries very fast and it doesn't make your skin oily. I am using it also on my belly and it's fantastic. The skin is soft, hydrated and no stretch marks. I will use it even after the delivery in order to help to preserve the elasticity of my belly skin. I can't say for sure if it's the product or my skin, but I think it's always good to give a try to a product that may help to reduce or prevent stretch marks and annoying dryness.\n",

            "I absolutely love this product! After years of struggling with acne, I got a medication that worked to clear it up. I initially bought this to even out my skin tone from acne scars, but use it for so much more. First, even with medication and a cleanser that works, when I used my expensive Clinique lotion, I broke out right away. I was worried this would make me break out, but it doesn't! It moisturizes and helps even out my skin tone without clogging my pores and making me break out. It dries quickly enough that I can apply my makeup within 5 minutes of applying it. My elbows are always crazy dry, so I use this every day on my elbows too and it helps greatly. I also have a large scar on my leg from a dog bite. That scar will never go away, but using the Bio-oil twice a day on it and smoothed it out and lightened it quite a bit. I have been and will continue to recommend this product! It does say on the bottle to give it a full 3 months before seeing results. That's true on reducing scarring, but you can tell immediately that it's a great moisturizer.\n",

            "I purchased this in the hope that it would help reduce stretch marks that I have on my stomach. They are new stretch marks that appeared a few months ago from weight gain that I'm working on losing. This oil has a pleasant scent and isn't sticky like other oils. My stretch marks don't appear to be fading. I did apply the oil to a tiny scar that had formed from a cat scratch and it is improving. I've not yet decided if I will purchase again for stretch marks. I may for things like scars or discoloration from bug bites. This is a good product and I like it. I feel it would work better for preventing stretch marks or fading discoloration. Stretch marks seem to be difficult to fade. I will be finishing the bottle and will update this post if I have any changes.\n",

Anyway, I'm pretty sure the product works when used religiously and correctly, one day I'll use it right lol. I recently got a burn on my arm too from a chemistry lab so I think I'll start using it again for that. Oh also, if you are concerned about you feeling super slick and greasy, you shouldn't be lol.

Like a lot of women that have had children, I ended up with some stretch marks. My stretch marks are mostly on my stomach and upper outer thighs. I had seen commercials for Bio Oil so I decided to read some reviews and see what people thought of it. After reading enough positive reviews, I decided to purchase it for myself. I have been using it for about 2 weeks now (twice a day) and there is definitely a noticeable difference in the appearance of my stretch marks. I was a little skeptical at first because I've tried other products that haven't helped at all. Bio Oil is really working for me though, and it's giving me my confidence back!! I didn't tell my fiance that I've been using this and HE even noticed a difference (it has to be a BIG difference for him to notice anything... you know how men are... LOL). I definitely recommend that everyone with stretch marks and/or scars tries this product. What do you have to lose?! It's only about $12 with shipping and it works better than ALL of the high end products I've tried!!\n",

I also began using it on other blemishes and marks on my legs and arms ALL fading tremendously. GREAT stuff!!!!

However, I had a dark mark on the right side of my nose due to picking at a pimple. I used Bio-oil on it for like 1 mo and slowing but surely it faded away. Now it is non-existent.I am now using it on two stubborn dark marks on the side of my forehead (temple area). They are taking longer to fade away but they are getting lighter and ligther everyday. I apply Bio-oil twice a day to the stubborn marks and other parts of my body when I get out of the shower. The product seems too work, smells great and is not too greasy.

I love the way it feels on my skin, and I am certain it has helped reduce the appearance of some rather unpleasant scars and possibly even lightened my stretch marks a tad. I don't always use it straight up, for one thing I mix it in with other oils and use it before I get out of the shower before drying off. Then  I put several squirts into my body lotion and mix it up because I figure it can't hurt and again, I really like the smell. For a particularly bad scar or new but healing mark, I will put this on by itself before applying my lotion. I do think it is priced a little high, but I like it so much that so far it is worth it.\n",

Bio oil has, over time, addressed both of those issues by reducing inflammation and reducing the appearance of my facial scars (I originally bought it because I heard it was used to reduce pregnancy stretch marks, and I figured if it worked for those it would work for my problem, which it has). It also makes my skin feel really smooth and soft.Generally, I put the product on when I sleep or when I know I'm not going to be leaving the house, and leave it on for as many hours as possible. It's really oily and doesn't absorb into the skin, so it will look gross if you wear it outside, but if you can find a way to leave it on for a long period of time, it works pretty well.\n",

            "I love this product. It's always sold out in stores so i order on here. It really works at fading and removing scars as long as you follow instructions by applying it twice a day.\n",
            "It leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized I’m almost In my second trimester so hopefully it does wonders.\n",
            "This is really good! My kids acne is pretty much under control with daily use of this oil.\n",
            "Very moisturizing, but does leave you looking like an oil slick. Kind of sits on top of your skin until it sinks in, which can take up to an hour.\n",
            "Love this stuff\n",
            "Bio-Oil has such a great, fresh scent. It works great on scars as well as stretch marks. It reduces itching that sometimes occurs with stretch marks and it seems to help reduced scar visability.\n",
            "First of all, I think it's important to point out that although Bio-Oil works quickly, the most prominent results are seen after a long period of use. I often see many reviewers complaining that it's not effective after only 1-2 weeks of use! This is not magic - it's science. It does not work overnight. You need to adapt Bio-Oil into your daily routine. It takes minimal effort and it's incredibly worth it. Results will be prominent after 1-2 months of consistent use.After looking at the results from the clinical trials, before/after pics on googles, celebs who use it, lots of user reviews, the ingredients in the product, etc I was convinced to purchase it. Before you buy any skin care product, I encourage you to look at the ingredients! Don't blindly purchase things and waste your money - do your research on the substances in the product! That being said, Bio Oil is a bottle of goodness...lots of vitamins and natural extracts. I didn't see any ingredient that is *specifically* meant for anti aging purposes (these would likely be things like polypeptides) so I wouldn't rely on this solely for anti aging results such as wrinkle reduction, unless you want to achieve a younger look through moisturizing - which is possible.I apply Bio-oil each night to before bed time. It is a greasy formula and I don't recommend wearing this under makeup - especially if you have combo/oily skin. It takes a while to absorb into your skin..maybe 10 minutes.  I have been using Bio-oil to help improve stretch marks and even out discoloration on my face (some natural discoloration around my mouth as well as some on my cheeks from acne scars). In terms of stretch marks I can vouch that Bio-oil works. Don’t expect them to disappear all together, I’m under no illusions that my stretch marks will ever vanish, however this oil has drastically faded them to a point where I'm more confident. The discoloration on my face has significantly faded. My skin feels very soft and smooth.I suggest that you buy the larger bottle of bio oil and not the mini size, as you'll get more for you money. Overall, I highly recommend Bio Oil!\n",
            "Not seeing any changes in the appearance of stretch marks on my tummy unfortunately.  I am almost through with the bottle and will not reorder.\n",
            "Not sure if it's working on scars but it's moisturizing well on my skin with a great scent.\n",
            "Used this product many times in past and will continue to for duration of life! Works well, fast delivery, product securely packaged!\n"

            "I bought this oil about 1 month ago. I wanted to wait a bit before a review. I want to say I have bad stretch marks after my two kids. I was 110 before both of them now weighing 120 I gained 50lbs for my 2nd baby, leaving my belly destroyed. I have so many it's embarrassing sometimes but I u have learned to live with them. I have tried many products, to try to at least demish them, nothing has work. I have tried this oil and it seams to be doing a good job, they are smoother, and less noticeable, but I will continue using untill I have better results. So far it's doing very good. Definitely recommend.\n",

            "I went ahead and read reviews on oils to use while pregnant to avoid stretchmarks. I first started out with the palmer's cocoa butter formula but hated the smell and texture. I then went ahead and tried this and also bought the Mama Mio oil. The two oils are pretty similar to one another but I prefer the bio-oil to the Mama Mio oil as it is easier to wash off your hands once you have applied. The price is also much better for the bio oil. I would definitely recommend this product. I'm currently 8 months pregnant and have no stretch marks and only use at night.\n",

In an effort to address these concerns, I use Tazorac, an Rx retinoid cream, during the summer and a Vitamin C serum during the winter. Bio-Oil is a great complement to these drying treatments. It has not caused my skin to break out. My skin is very sensitive; I am prone to eczema and keloid scarring (despite being a pale redhead).Although this is an \"oil\", it absorbs much faster than natural oils like jojoba, which left me feeling greasy. It also has a nice rosy smell. I find this product relaxing to apply before bed and often use it all over my body after exfoliating in the shower.\n",

My Mom had stretch marks (8 kids). 3 of my sisters have stretch marks while one has none (she didn't use any products for prevention). I did start noticing a few little red dots on the bottom of my belly at 30 weeks, but as of today, they have not connected like a stretch mark. They still look like just little red dots. I'm keeping my fingers crossed and hope that's the worse they're going to get.The reason why I gave it a 4 star is because it's uncomforablly oily. I slather it on, then put a light tank top on, then my regular clothes and this seems to help me feel a bit more comfortable. My sister who has very oily skin did not like this product but I have very dry skin so it seems to \"fade\" into my skin after about 20-30 minutes. I use it 2x a day, morning and evening.\n",

They have faded significantly (more \"white\" than red) and I've had the hardest time getting them to diminish.  I've tried body butters, Strivectin, argan oil, tea tree oil, self-tanners, cocoa butter...the list goes on.Honestly, I've been using this product pretty regularly for about two months, and haven't seen a difference in the stretch marks themselves.  However, I have seen a huge improvement in my skin--Bio Oil makes your skin incredibly soft and smooth.  I started using it on my chest too, to prevent stretch marks in those areas.  For a night out, you can put Bio Oil all over your body--it will give you a beautiful, subtle glow without being oily or sticky.  It's replaced my cocoa butter oil completely, and even though it is a bit more expensive, a little product goes a long way.I love Bio Oil, but it turns out that I don't love it for what I originally bought it for.

I have very smooth skin after about 2 weeks of consistent use. Really inexpensive and easier to put make up on with smooth skin. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because there should be a sponge or some kind of applicator on top of the bottle so you could apply it easier with less mess. Right now you have to pour it on your fingers and then apply it to your face and it runs down my arm sometimes. Really greasy but the smooth skin is worth it.

My baby is 10 weeks old now and I am still not back to my normal weight, I still have 6 more lbs to go. Don't know if I'll get any once I lose those lbs.

It helps to really massage it in, not just rub it on. I will continue to use the oil and see what happens...I put on a little weight from 7 months bed rest and stared getting stretch marks on my arms I have tried the bio oil for about 1 month now and so far no luck in lightening them but will keep trying, I do have to say I am not as committed to the stretch marks as I was to the knee scar so I am sure that has an effect.

It IS an oil, so you will feel a bit greasy when you place it on your skin - but your skin will also absorb it pretty fast. Has a nice gentle scent.I can't guarantee that it will work for you, but it's certainly easier to trial than a $100 lotion  :) I'm super happy with it and I will certainly buy again.\n",

Did nothing for scars, pigmentation, or moisturization. I broke out constantly, and I attribute this to the mineral oil content. I gave 2 stars for the eyelashes, but honestly? Coconut oil does the same for them and is much cheaper. This might do what it claims for others, it just didn't for me. I am disappointed in myself for shelling out this amount of $.

I injured my arm on a screw that was protruding from a piece of wood and had a long visible scar (about 1\") after it healed.  I would use the bio-oil every day and within two weeks, it started to get smaller.  It has been about 6 weeks now and it is about half-an-inch long and is less visible.  I bought more of the Bio-oil from Amazon for other scars that have been around for a long time.  I will be sure to keep the oil on hand in case I may need it in the future.\n",

There was also a slight variation in the verbiage.My questions sent to the company through their website under the 'contact us' link were:Are color variations normal? The color of the new bottle is orange, while the color of my first bottle was pink.Has Bio Oil changed the verbiage of their packaging? The first bottle read \"Specialist moisturizer for\" and the new one read \"Helps improve the appearance of\"I trust my mom's choice of cosmetics, and if this new package is not authentic I won't use it. I ordered before I was out of the sample my mom gave me so I wouldn't miss a beat. It's been about a week since I tried to contact them, bottle sitting there unopened.

I suffer from adult acne and this helps to keep my skin clear and soft.  It's as if it has some kind of exfoliating properties to it.

It has \"bio\" in the name, has friendly script on the label, and even the touted ingredient, \"PurCellin oil\" sounds good, like \"pure\" and \"cells\", suggesting it's pure and doing something on the cellular level. Your basic feel-good marketing.To the good, yes, it's light, it spreads and absorbs somewhat easily.  It even smells very nice.  To the bad, it has done nothing for my slightly uneven skin tone, nor for dry skin patches on knees and ankles.  Maybe it does more for scars and stretch marks, but it didn't handle these \"easier\" issues well.  (To at least use the stuff up, I've been sweeping it on my lips before bed, and it has not done half as well in protecting and softening as the old DCT.)And Bio-Oil's first ingredient is -ooooh- \"Paraffinum Liquidum\".  Let's call a spade a spade - that's mineral oil!  You could get a bucket of mineral oil for less than this 2 oz. bottle.Fool me twice?  Not bloody likely.\n",

I have not destroyed any of my clothing yet but i have heard that people cant get out oil spots when they use this.

It kind of dries to where my clothes don't stick to my skin and i don't feel gross or anything. I used this in the winter so I can't say what it's like in summer when your skin is gross anyway from sweat. Great product for any condition which causes skin to stretch--including post surgical procedures. I used this daily for about two months on a moderate size area. Barely made a dent in the bottle. A smaller bottle would have been way more than I needed. Now I get to pass a mostly unused bottle on to my pregnant sister. Yay.\n",

It's embarrassing because it's right in the middle of my chest.Started using bio oil and noticed a difference within a couple of weeks. I've been using it for a month now and the scar is noticeably less red and not as raised. I tried massaging prior to this with tea tree oil and lavender but it did not work. Essential oils dried out my skin but bio oil keeps it moisturized. I use this right after I come out of the shower and right before bed time (it says to use twice a day).I also started using it on my face because I have some uneven skin tone and some old acne scars. It's cleared up my face and I swear my skin is brighter now. It's softer, too. I use it on my face same way, after a shower and at night. I've been doing this for a week and noticed a difference. My scar is more traumatic so I think it took longer to see a difference but this stuff works! 36 month shelf life and smells amazing too.

I have very sensitive skin and I haven't broken out because of this, although it does leave my face feeling a little oily during the day (but I just apply some makeup powder and it's not an issue).
